So she was very happy  to start a new job at a suburb private practice in North Square near the Duke Street Tower.  That area was much nearer for her and more to her liking. Even so, on her first morning,  she felt stressed. She ate a bowl of porridge, checked herself in the mirror, and washed her face  in a hurry. Then she put on a plain yellow dress and a fleece jacket, picked up her kit and  headed for work. When she got there, there was a woman with a goose waiting for her. The woman  gave Sarah an official letter from the vet. The letter implied that the animal could be suffering  from a rare form of foot and mouth disease, which was surprising, because normally you would only  expect to see it in a dog or a goat. Sarah was sentimental, so this made her feel sorry for the  beautiful bird. Before long, that itchy goose began to strut around the office like a lunatic,  which made an unsanitary mess. The goose's owner, Mary Harrison, kept calling,  come, come, which Sarah thought was an odd choice for her name. Cama was a strong and huge,  so it would take some force to strap her, trapper. But Sarah had a different idea.  First, she tried gently stroking the goose's lower back with her palm, then singing a tune to her.  Finally, she administered ether. Her efforts were not futile. In no time, the goose began to tire,  so Sarah was able to hold onto Cama and give her a relaxing bath. Once Sarah had managed to  bathe the goose, she wiped her off with a cloth and laid her on her right side. Then Sarah confirmed  the vet's diagnosis. Almost immediately, she remembered an effective treatment that required her to  measure out a lot of medicine. Sarah warned that this course of treatment might be expensive either  five or six times the cost of penicillin. I can't imagine paying so much, but Mrs. Harrison,",
