  "story_text": "Well, here's a story for you.  Sarah Perry was a veterinarian nurse who had been working daily at an old zoo in a deserted  district of the territory, so she was very happy to start a new job at a superb private  practice in North Square near the Duke Street Power.  That area was much nearer for her and more to her liking.  Even so, on her first morning, she felt stressed.  She ate a bowl of porridge, checked herself in the mirror, and washed her face in a hurry.  Then she put a plain yellow dress in a fleece jacket, picked up her kit, and headed to  work.  When she got there, she was a woman with a goose waiting for her.  The woman gave Sarah an official letter from the vet.  The letter implied that the animal could be suffering from a rare form of foot and mouth  disease, which was surprising, because normally you would only expect to see it in a dog  or a goat.  Sarah was sentimental, so this made her feel sorry for the beautiful bird.  Before long, the itchy goose began to strut around the office, like a lunatic, which made  an unsanitary mess.  The goose's owner, Mary Harrison, kept calling Comma, which Sarah thought was an odd  choice for a name.  Comma was strong and huge, so it would take some force to trap her, but Sarah had a different  idea.  She tried gently stroking the goose's lower back with her palm, then singing a tune  to her.  Finally, she administered ether.  Her efforts were not futile.  In no time, the goose began to tire, so Sarah was able to hold onto Comma and gave her  a relaxing bath.  When Sarah had managed to bathe the goose, she wiped off with the cloth and laid her  on her right side, then Sarah confirmed the vet's diagnosis.  Almost immediately, she remembered an effective treatment that required her to measure out  a lot of medicine.  Sarah warned that this course of treatment might be expensive, either five or six times  a cost of penicillin.  I can't imagine paying so much, but Miss Harrison, a millionaire lawyer, thought it was",
