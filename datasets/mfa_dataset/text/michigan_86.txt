I’ve worked at Wayne State [University] for the last 10 years. I’m now in my eleventh year, and I’m in my third office on campus. I enjoy the campus; I love the student life and I enjoy having the activities, um, at my disposable — disposal on campus. Currently, I work in the alumni association office. And I am more like an office manager. I, uh, make sure that everything runs smoothly, personnel positions are filled constantly, paperwork and bills are paid and processed accurately. I’ve only been in this job for the last seven months. I enjoy it tremendously. The work sometime is tedious, but the people make it worthwhile to come into work every day. In addition to my work at Wayne State, I also house-sit as a means of additional income. By house-sitting, I, um, volunteer to watch people’s pets, um, when they go out of town. I get to, uh, leave my home and have a mini-vacation. I get to walk their animals. I get to play with other dogs that I know I could never have in my home. And I get to see parts of the city that I usually don’t get to see. I love to hit — housesit on the east side of this city because that’s where most of the nicer homes are. I get to experience their restaurants and their neighborhoods and feel a lot safer, um, at their homes than I do, actually, at my own.
