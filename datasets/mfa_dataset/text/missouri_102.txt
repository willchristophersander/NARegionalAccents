I was born in Kansas City, Missouri, 1949. I, uh, have lived here for th– uh, fifty years. Um, I had two different jobs. I worked for Universal Pictures, and then I came to Revere Plaza and I’ve been here ten years. OK, I have Suzy, a Chihuahua. I have ’lizabeth, uh, a Boston bull, and I have Bullis, German shepherd, and they play outside a– all the time. An’ they have lots of fun playin’ out in the yard, an’ then they like to eat bacon for breakfast, and stuff like that. I, I went to Askew to grade school, and then we went to East High, to high school, and the teachers were all, all very nice. Uh, Miss Kaiser. Y’know, I was on the bus one day, and we was goin’ down the street, an’ the car stopped in front o’ them, an’ they hit the po’e. An’ got a big boo-boo on my wittle head. So I went to the doctor’s office, an’ they took care of it, an’ I’s back to work.
