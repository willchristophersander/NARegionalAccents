Well, it’s been kinda fun; we’ve been getting ready for Heather’s wedding, and then, this past weekend, I went to the wedding of the son of one of my high school friends, and when we were in high school there were about eight or nine of us who ran around together mainly because we weren’t from Florence and hence were judged lower than dirt by the people who were natives of Florence, and, of course, y’know, wonderful people. And, so anyhow, we all ran around together, and we have stayed in touch over the years, and what was fun was to look at how different the wedding customs and all are now, and what we’re planning for Heather and what pat had for Jamie, and what we all want. I mean, weddings were really almost an endurance contest back then, y’know; we had our showers, and all of us had to wear stockings and, and heels, and I have a picture of about five of us in a receiving line, and now this was for all of our friends. Y’know, it wasn’t people we didn’t know, but you had to have the receiving line, and we all have on our hats and our white gloves, and, of course, we’re all very thin and very young looking back then, and we’ve had a shower for Heather, couple weeks ago, and the guys were invited too, and it was a couples shower, and it was because they’ve just bought a new house; it was a yard and garden shower, which nobody ever thought of having back in the 60s. We got lots of silver and crystal and other things which gather dust in the cabinet a whole lot, y’know. They got hoses and lawn ornaments and, y’know, things that they are — have already put to use they didn’t even wait for the wedding, which was another big no-no, y’know. We were hardly allowed to open ’em, but we certainly couldn’t use them. They had — the dining room was taken over by shelves that you rented from this little old lady who kept them in her garage, and, and then you displayed all of your gifts on these shelves, and everybody stopped by to visit the bride and her family and see all the gifts, and that was a big social event, y’know; it was like having an open house for weeks on end.
