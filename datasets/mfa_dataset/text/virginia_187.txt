OK, so I live in Springfield, Virginia. I’ve lived in Springfield for 18 years, you … from birth to now. And it’s a great place to grow up. It’s, um, it’s not a huge city and it’s not rural. It’s about 20 minutes outside of D.C. and, I mean, everything you’d want to do as a kid, it’s there. I have one brother. He’s three and a half years younger than me. I have two incredibly loving parents that I love. Um, well that sounded redundant. Um, I have an amazing dog named Pippin and right now he’s 3 years old. He just had his birthday in January. And he’s, I think, the cutest creature living in the world. Um, as of this year I go to college. Um, I’m going to Michigan State University. I’ve been here for a semester and a half-ish now? Um, I’m studying theater and I’m looking to add a double major in music. In about two weeks, actually, I have an audition so I’m kind of freaking out. I’m nervous. But we’ll see how that goes. Um, I am extremely musical; I love playing instruments. I played clarinet for ten years. I sing. I, I act. It’s just … theater’s a huge, monumental part of my life. And I don’t know what I would do if I didn’t have some sort of outlet for my incredibly dramatic self. Yea, so that’s basically it. I’m just your average normal girl. Um, I love to travel. I absolutely love it. I’ve been to a bazillion different countries. I went to New Zealand and Australia about four years ago. Um, two years ago I went on a music tour playing clarinet, um, across Europe which was incredible. We went to, let’s see, we went to London, we went to France, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, uh Italy; let’s see, um, we spent like two seconds in Lichtenstein. And we had a transfer flight to the Netherlands, so we never actually got to, you know, step outside and see the Netherlands but we were there. So, um, yea, I’m musical. I love to act. I love to travel. I love my dog. I love my parents. I love my family and I’m from Virginia. So, there we go.
