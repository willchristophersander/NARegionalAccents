Hi! Welcome to Buffalo! If you’ve never heard of us, well that’s not actually that surprising. While Buffalo, once upon a time, was a big and important area, not so much anymore. We are thoroughly part of The Rust Belt. Heh Heh. Yeah, what a great thing. Um, I’m 25 years old, and I’ve lived in this area for most of my life. Um. I was born in Winchester, Virginia, which is about as far away as you can get from Buffalo. I have no memory of living there. I moved up here when I was about eight months old. So, pretty much all I can tell you about is Buffalo and what it’s like to live here. Um, we have terrific, hot, summers that go into beautiful fall and finally into a bone-chilling winter. Which we all conveniently stay in our houses and only go out when we absolutely have to — shocking that would happen in winter. Uh, for some people winter would be very difficult to survive around here, particularly if you are used to a more mild winter like in Southern California, you won’t enjoy Buffalo. We get cold temperatures, like right now, if the weather is thirty degrees it’s practically balmy! Ehh, and if you go downtown, the wind gets so bad you might even go hypothermic if you stay out there for a couple hours, even if you are used to the area, like we are. And let’s face it: Not everyone here is used to the weather. So, you gotta be careful. Y’know?
