My mother gave birth on a stormy January night in 1920 in a homeopathic hospital in Boston, Mass. My first eight years were spent in a double-decker bottom-floor flat surrounded by neighbors from Ireland, Poland and England. Our family read by gaslight, and Mom cooked on a coal stove and a gas stove, which often ran out of gas in the middle of preparing supper. But not to worry: An oil lamp and matches were kept close by. Meanwhile, Dad would get a quarter out of an old sugar bowl, and sometimes he would put me on his shoulder and let me drop the coin in the meter in the hallway. One memorable day some workmen arrived to install the wires for electricity. I remember sitting on the brick sidewalk, dangling my feet through the cellar window as I watched them work. The fixtures they put in the parlor had beautiful orange frosted globes that cast a warm glow, and I’m sure that is why, to this day, orange is my favorite color. From Boston, I lived there for eight years. Then we went maybe thirty miles to Quincy, which was on the water, and I spent the next twenty-one years there. And then we moved inland a bit again to Braintree, Mass., which is … was maybe fifteen or twenty miles away, and we spent twenty-three years there.
