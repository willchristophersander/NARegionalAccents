Well, I was born in Denver, and my grandparents live here, all of them. So I moved here when I was going into sixth grade, so probably I was about 12. And I hated it. And I cried a lot, a lot, a lot. But then, uh, I r– actually r — really fell in love with it. And I’m really glad that we moved here. And, and it’s funny, because a lot of people will have this in — sort of, they hate it so much and there’s nothing to do. But, uh, you find stuff to do. And, and, um, we all go to the bowling alley a lot. And a lot of time we don’t really even bowl. And there’s really that or the swimming pool is, like, the biggest thing to do. And nobody really goes to the swimming pool. But, uh, then we all longboard down Main Street at night. Everybody cruises Main Street in their trucks — all the younger kids, or course. And my mom actually said that she did that when she was younger, that everybody would just pile into a vehicle and just cruise up and down, and everybody sits in the school parking lot and talks. And we always go to the lake and, uh, we always just hang out at people’s houses. It’s not — it’s definitely a lot different than, you know, a big city where you can just go to Walmart or the mall or, whenever you want and hang out. I mean, y– you have to, um, really find something to do and use your imagination. But it’s a lot of fun. And we have a lot of fun. And, I mean, we figure stuff out to do.
