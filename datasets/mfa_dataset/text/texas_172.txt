I gonna tell a story ’bout — a little bit about me. I come from Saragossa P[unclear]la, Mexico. I was li– … uh, I was born in Riopas, Texas, but I … well, my family took me to Mexico. Uh, I come from a family of five brothers, well, four brothers, one sister. I’m the thir’ one in the family. Um, my parents got divorce when I was, like, 15, 16. An’ my town is a little, little town, where all you can do is start drinkin’ at age of 12 or 13. There’s no movies, there’s no parks, there’s no sports. There’s nothing there, so … I also start, y’know, like that age, 12, 13, I started to drink. That, that was what everyone does over there. An’ now that I’m 22, I think that was not, like, a good way to, to start bein’ a kid. So, when I were 15, 15, 16, I decide to, to come to the United States, because I, I didn’t see future of me staying in that town. An’ we don’t have like, like big schools, jus’ like high school. That was it. Um, so, right now I — my dream is become an actor, director. I do — I have no idea how am I gonna get there, but that’s my — that’s my point, so, ah, I’m in the University of Southwest on San Marcos an’ I changed my major. I ’s supposed to be a business major, so I change it to th-, ah, theatre, because I don’ like business at all. So now I’m here. I — las’ I dunno maybe two or three years in my other career. But now, ah, I gonna graduate. I hope in, uh, one more year. …
