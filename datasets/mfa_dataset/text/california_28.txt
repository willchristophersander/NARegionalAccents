I was born is Santa Monica, California. When I was a kid, my parents — both of which are four generations in in Los Angeles. My mom is actually a little bit older in a generation; she’s part American Indian from Los Angeles Basin. When I was a kid, ah, moved to, ah, Canoga Park. And then, ah, I went to high school in, ah, Chatsworth, which is, ah, west valley. But, ah, I have always retained my, ah, passion for the beach — ah, Santa Monica and Venice. My cousins, ah, were always surfers. My family has always been involved in surfing, skateboarding. Um, my cousins actually starting with amongst other people Dogtown, in Venice, California. I used to work at Venice off Winward where, ah, I sold clothes for my uncle and, ah, weird things were even happening then. Um, my grandma had, like, the first female owned nursery in, I think Los Angeles, I’m pretty sure. And my grandfather owned a piece of the mountain where, ah, this radio tower’s on. So it basically, ah, pretty rooted in Los Angeles. Lots of change. I just kinda wish it was a small town because, um, a lot of people come and go here, a lot of people look for stars they can’t catch. And then they kinda end up here. It’d be kinda nice to have more of an idea of a home town for Los Angeles. Ah, that’s my idea. Most of my friends have moved away.
