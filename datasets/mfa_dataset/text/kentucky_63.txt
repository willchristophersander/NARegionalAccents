I was born in Flemingsburg, Kentucky; raised in a small town in Kentucky called Nepton. I graduated from Fleming County High School in 1985; graduated from Morehead State University with a BA in social work in 1990 and also took classes at the University of Kentucky towards a masterâ€™s in social work. Currently I work for the state of Kentucky as a social-service clinician II. I recruit foster and adoptive parents for the state of Kentucky and train them and also do monthly home visits with foster and adoptive parents.
