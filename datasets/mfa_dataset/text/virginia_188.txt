I went to church early, and then after that I also had some people I took out on a tour and, like every other time, we become friends, we share stuff and tell about each other and go out, and we were in the boat and it was pretty — it wasn’t rough. [Interviewer: How were your crab pots today?] They were full. They were — they were pretty, and I’ll twist and turn tonight thinking about how many crabs are in the crab pots. And then my son and his girlfriend have been here the weekend and I got back in, and right after I dropped the tour people off my son said how bout — let’s go out, Dad, and I said “Come on, then.” I said, “I’ll take you out, too.” And we came back in and got something to eat and watched a little bit of the Patriots and the New York Jets. I like Tom Brady but I’m not — I’m not really rooting against the Jets, though. They have so many troubles; they don’t need anybody rooting against them!
