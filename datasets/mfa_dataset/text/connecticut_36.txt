I was born in Hartford, Connecticut, and grew up in a town called Burlington, Connecticut, which is a, very small, uh, town, kind of in between Torrington and Hartford, in the, northwest corner of, of, uh, the state. Uh we had, um, a lot of, space in, the town, because it was kind of rural, so, uh most of my childhood, uh, all of our friends and I would play outside, um, go back into the woods, go into the fields behind people’s houses, find streams, climb up on rocks; it was, a really, um, great place to grow up. Well we would play, my, m-my neighbors and I would do everything, uh, would do — spend a lot of time together because we were closest in age in our little, um, the little block of our street, so, we would, play video games together, we would play outside together, we played baseball, with a tennis ball though, not with a real baseball, we’d play backyard, backyard baseball with a tennis ball, um, so everyone could hit it, out of the park, and, we also would go sledding every winter. We had — we lived kind of on the side of a steep hill, so, um, on the backyard and in the front yard, there was a steep hill, so it just depended whether you wanted to crash into your own house or if you wanted to s-sled downhill and crash into the — into the street. Um, we also had water gun fights, and, we would have fights with the, apples that fell, um, from the trees that were in our front yard, so we would, um, climb the trees and pick up apple — apples off the ground, or, just pull them out of the tree —they were small crab apples — and, um, use them like snowballs. Um, so, we had lots of, kind of silly competitive games, when we were growing up.
