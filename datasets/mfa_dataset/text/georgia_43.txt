Well, grew up in Athens, Georgia; not really a Bulldog’s fan though. Grew up in the sticks, I guess you would call it, back in the country. Me and my older sister, we used to go down to the creek and look for different rocks and Indian arrowheads and whatnot. And then, uh, there was this one Saturday; me and my cousin were on a four-wheeler, I think I was in seventh grade at the time. And, uh, we went, we hit this hill and flew up in the air, and I was holding on to the four-wheeler wrong so I was just, so it broke my arm in two places. So I remember that; those were always good times, and then, um, I was really big in sports, played a lot of football growin’ up, on the wrestlin’ team, then I started playin’ golf, probably around my sophomore year in high school. And then uh, changed schools my senior year, ’cause I could get more college prep classes down in Tifton, where I was born, so I transferred down to Tifton County High School, where I graduated from. I did a year of college at Abraham Baldwin Agricultural College, and then, you know I thought this whole college thing wasn’t for me. So I decided to join the Marine Corps, so I ended up doing that for four years, two tours of Iraq, and then, uh, I was like yep, it’s about time I get back in college, so, now I’m a theatre major at Auburn University, havin’ a blast; I love it, it’s a great program. But, uh, that’s about it.
