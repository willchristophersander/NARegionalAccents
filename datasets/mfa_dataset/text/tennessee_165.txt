I was born in Hendersonville, Tennessee, at a hospital out in Hendersonville, in Nashville. I grew up in Joelton. It’s kind of the country area part of Nashville, very rural; we had no neighbors growing up, so we were never, like, playing with the kids, your neighborhood kids. We were never allowed to ride our bikes everywhere cause we were just at the creek all the time and playing out in the yard making mud pies. Um, I guess I have two little nieces and a nephew that I love to play with all the time, and they have this sweet little elf on a shelf that comes to visit them at Thanksgiving, and he does little mischievous things; he’s also Santa’s little helper, so he will report to Santa how good the child has been. Um, he likes to hang from the ceiling fan; he has hung from light fixtures; he has rolled the Christmas tree before. What else? He has made snow angels out of flower on the counter top in the kitchen. Um, we always just kind of make a little fun thing for the kids about it. Once a week he’ll do something mischievous.
