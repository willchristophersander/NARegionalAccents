So, I was born in York, Pennsylvania. Uh, that’s, um, about three counties west of Philadelphia. Uh, and when I was, uh, between 1 and 2 years old, my parents moved, uh, thirty miles east to, uh, Lancaster County, and, uh, I lived in Lancaster County, uh, until, uh, I was about 20. I attended college a couple of years back in York, commuting back and forth. So, until I was 20, I was i– in my — I lived right there in, uh, Lancaster and York counties. When I was 20 I went to, uh, uh, to college in State College, Pennsylvania, right in the middle of Pennsylvania, and I, I wound up getting a job there after I graduated. So I lived, uh, a total of about, uh, seven years in State College. And then in 1988, I got a job in Nome, Alaska, and I’ve, uh, lived in Nome for a couple o’ years, and then, now in Fairbanks.

Uh, my speech, um, the thing that people tend to notice the most is, uh, I say “yous” for, uh, second-person plural pronoun. And, uh, my wife, uh, still razzes me about that. She, uh, just can’t, uh, can’t get over that I say “yous” or “yous going to the store.” Um, I’ve noticed that, um, uh, there’s a few words that, um, you know, the dictionary says should rhyme, but don’t rhyme for me. And, uh, for instance, uh, I say “mad,” and that does not rhyme with “fad,” uh, in my speech. The same thing with sad, so that’s, uh …
