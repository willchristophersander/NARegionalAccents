I’m 42, and I was born in Chillán, Chile. Uh, my parents were American; we were, uh, they were from Mississippi, and we came back to Mississippi immediately after I was born. And, uh, grew up in Jackson, Mississippi, and lived there, uh, for most of my life, and I lived in Hattiesburg, Mississippi, also. It was fantastic, uh … growing up in Mississippi was incredible. The, the, uh, it was very idealistic, uh, for me. In terms of we hunted a lot, and fished, and uh, we were in the outdoors a lot, so it was great. Uh, I remember like when I was a lil’ younger, I, I caught um, a, uh, a venomous snake, a, a water moccasin, and I was scared to let go of it. So my neighbor got a garbage can and took the lid off, and she said, “OK, now you throw it in there,” and I opened the eh, uh [snicker], so I did that [snicker]. And uh, it snowed when I was about 5 and I decided I was gonna r- which was very rare, so I decided I was gonna run naked through the neighborhood too, so that was a good, time [laughs]. For the most part it was, y’know, for the first thirty years of my life Mississippi was the main, place. Uh, I do remembe- my, uh, my grandmother, um, who was named er, Irlene [spelling?] Puckett … uh, had a lot of dialect words that are lost now. And she was from Scottish stock, and bor- she was born in 1911. So, she would have heard a lot of words, from older people when she was a little girl that were in use in the- probably in the earlier part of the, um, of the mid-early to mid-nineteenth century. So, for ghost she would say, haint. Uh, and she used a h- a holler, a hollow, uh, like a, y’know, a little, not a valley but like a, not a ditch and not a valley but in between. So a hollow was a holler, and a ghost was a haint. And to give up the ghost was to die. So, you were giving the ghost up, you, were would mean the ghost was leaving your body. So that was to give up the ghost.
