OK, so here I am, and again I say, I work at Temple University. Um, I’ve been here a long time, but not as long as a lot of people I know. And I’m married and I have two absolutely gorgeous children. Their names are Mira, who’s 21, and Kenny, who’s 17 and a half. And again, I’m happily married – to Nick Frye, who’s my buddy . Uh, let’s see, what else can I tell you about myself? I lived in Philadelphia just about all my life. I was – Nick is my second husband. I was married for seven years to Bob, my children’s dad. And, uh, I’ve traveled a lot, although not that much in my latter years, more in my twenties. And, um, I do my best to live by the Golden Rule and do unto others as I would have others do unto me. And really value friendship and love and integrity, as directions to move towards in life.
