Uh, I grew up in Lander, Wyoming, um, which is a, uh, a small town in central Wyoming. Um, it has population of about 7,000 people. Uh, I was born and raised there; I graduated high school, um, from, uh, from the, uh, high school there. I actually just had my 10-year class reunion over the fourth of July weekend, which was, uh, I was actually in charge of it because I was the, uh, class president. Um, I, uh, I’m married; I just had my one-year anniversary also in July. Uh, we just purchased our first home together. And, um, the things that, uh, we enjoy doing is traveling. Um, we went to Greece for our honeymoon, and, uh, we just actually got back from a trip to Scotland where we traveled with my husband’s parents for a few weeks. Um, when I’m not travelling I’m, uh, working as an attorney in a small private-practice firm. It’s a, uh, general practice, but I specialize in family law. I represent children in juvenile actions and, um, I do some criminal law and, uh, chapter 7 bankruptcies. Um, as far as personal hobbies, I really enjoy cooking, um, and, uh, I enjoy, uh, settling into my new home, which, um, I , I think we’re really gonna enjoy.
