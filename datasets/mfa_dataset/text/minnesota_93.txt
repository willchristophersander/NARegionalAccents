Sure, I set my alarm for 5, and, uh, I get up and check the Internet, ’cause I work in Minneapolis public schools and they have the whole system on the Internet. So I get up and I look at the Internet and see if there’s anything there that I want, ’cause every single absence for a teacher, or a librarian, or whatever, is up on this Website. And so, I go and see if there’s anything there that I want [laughs], ’cause I only get to choose the morning of; that’s one of the conditions of my employment. So, uh, so I look through and see if there’s anything appealing, usually high school ’cause that’s what I like better, and if there’s not, I set my alarm for 5:25, maybe, and take a nap. And then I get up again, and go on the Website, check it out. And I do that, like, all morning, so I’m very good at napping in the morning. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah! You know, you have classes of kids who see you like a young teacher and they’re excited about that, and so they’re like, oh, they wanna talk to you and know about you, and they’re intelligent and nice to people, and … but most days are challenging, ’cause I mean, even the, the people who you talk to in regular life, who are really nice, wonderful people, they’re like, “Oh, man, you shoulda seen what I did to our substitute teacher.” [laughs] Like everyone mistreats the substitute teacher, you know?
