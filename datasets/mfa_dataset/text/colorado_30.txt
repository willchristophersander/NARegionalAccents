Um, I was born in Denver at Presbyterian Hospital, which was at the time not Pres. Saint Luke’s, but it was Presbyterian. And it was on 18th and about Gaylord, something like that? And I was born in 1928. And, um, my sisters — I have two sisters, one older, one younge — we were all born at the same hospital. And, uh, I grew up in Park Hill. And I went to Stedman Elementary School and Smiley Junior High School and East Denver High School. I then went to the University of Denver and, um, I majored in theatre because I didn’t have any other idea what I could possibly do. So I majored in theatre. And it has proved to be a — a good omen for me. And, um, I was married at age 20 to the boy next door, practically. And I have three children who are older than I ever thought they’d be. Um, I c- must say that some of my best experiences theatrically were at the Bonfils Theatre on East Colfax, where I was a resident director for, um, seventeen years. And when that theater closed I was — um, I had to find more work. Actually, I have worked out of town a bit. But, um, and I have directed in many other cities. But Denver is home. And it will always be home. I love Colorado. I love the mountains. I love everything about Denver. I think the climate is superb. And we’re lucky enough to have four seasons here, well, maybe three. I don’t think we have much spring, but we have a winter and we have summer and we have a gorgeous fall. So I think that Denver is the best city in the world to live in, and I can’t imagine being any h- happier anywhere else.
