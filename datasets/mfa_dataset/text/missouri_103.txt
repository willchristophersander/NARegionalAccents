I’m a lector at my church. Maybe I, I read about once a month, an’ I also read at another church, w– on the third Sunday of the month. And, um, it’s something that I very much enjoy, an’ look forward to. An’ it takes a lot of preparation, rehearsal for your readings. And, um, you’re … it’s your re– it’s really your responsibility to, to help the assembly understand the readings. I have some friends, that live very close. And they got a cat, about a year and a half ago. And I was kind of against this, them getting a cat, because I, I don’t know why, but I just was kind of against it. But then when I met their cat, which they named Emma, I fell in love with her. An’ I think a lot of her, and I am her regular babysitter, or cat-sitter [laughs], which I enjoy very much. She likes to sit on my lap an’ watch television with me, an’ maybe take a nap on my lap. I live in a high-rise apartment on the twentieth floor of my building, which I very much enjoy, ’s’ there’s a wonderful view. Can see for miles an’ miles, an’ I enjoy it. I enjoy the, the height, except when it storms, and then I do not like living on the twentieth floor of my building.
