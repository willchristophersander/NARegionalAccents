I was born in Kansas City, Missouri. My folks, when I was about 6 months old, moved to Wamsutter, Wyoming. I lived there until I went away to high school for a short period of time. Then came back home, lived a little while, came to the University of Wyoming, graduated in the college of Eng-Engli-, er, Education, I’m sorry, in 1957. I traveled with my husband, who was in the service, to Texas, California, Washington. We came back, made our home in Laramie, Wyoming. I owned a business here, and now I’m in sales and I’ve been here. I’m 72 years old, so I think probably I know the language pretty well.
