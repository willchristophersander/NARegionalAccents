Amarillo, Texas. Ah, North Texas, up in the Panhandle. 22. In Huntsville, Texas. I am going to Sam Houston State University. I’ll be starting my junior year in the fall. Yeah, I have a younger sister that’s 19, and a brother that’s 12 and a brother that’s 6. And my parents are divorced, so I have lived with my mom and my dad, my step-dad since I was 5. So I’m not very close to my real dad. Well, my mom is white and my dad was Hispanic, and since I didn’t really get to know him, I probably am the most whitest Mexican you’ve ever met in your life. No, no, I don’t even like Mexican food. I am not a big sport person. I love to stay out by the pool; I love the sun. But I like to do scrap-booking, I take a lot of photographs, I make a lot of scrap books. The weather up there is very cold. The weather down here doesn’t get that cold at all. It’s very humid down here; it’s not near as humid up there. I don’t know, I haven’t lived there since I was little; I was in the fifth grade. I lived down here for a long time. I moved, actually whenever my parents split up when I was 5, I moved to Wichita Falls, Texas, and lived there until I was in the fifth grade whenever my step-dad got a job at Dow and we went down to Lake Jackson, and so I’ve lived there ever since until college.
