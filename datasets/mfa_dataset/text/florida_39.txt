I am a public-communications major at Florida Atlantic University. That’s located in Boca Raton. I am currently living, um, 20 minutes south of there. I take I-95 back and forth. Um, because FAU is right off I-95, it’s, it’s just east of there, and I live right off I-95 as well. There is another highway which I could take, the Turnpike, but that would be completely out of my way. Um, 20 minutes, 25 minutes, it’s not, it’s not a huge ordeal, but, um, traffic can be pretty bad in the morning, rush hour definitely. And coming home at around 4 or 5 o’clock. Gas can also get expensive coming back and forth, although now gas prices are pretty decent, I have to say. Um, when I go to the gas station, I, pay for gas. I usually use my, my debit card and, and you know, I usually use regular gas and put it in my gas tank – make sure the engine’s off. Um, and, I pump it and fill it. Pretty much I always fill it up, um, all the way so I don’t have to make as many trips to the gas station. I try not to drive on empty at all. The classes I’m currently taking at FAU are, um, Communication, Gender, and Language. I’m taking Ethnicity and Communication. I’m taking Small-Group Processes. And I’m also taking a sociology class, um, Human Sexuality and Social Change. Um, I like my classes a lot right now. It’s about fifteen credits of classes I’m taking. Um, my teachers can be, seem a little hard, but they’re, I think, I think they’re, they’re really good. And, oh also I’m taking Mass Communication Theory as well. That’s, that’s another class that I, I definitely need to take. But I’m really enjoying the semester so far. Next semester I hope to take up an internship of of some sort. Whether it’s working for a news station or something along those lines.
