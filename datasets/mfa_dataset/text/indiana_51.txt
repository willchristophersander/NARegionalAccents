I was born on July 8, 1990, in Hammond, Indiana, and I was raised in Schererville, Indiana, in Lake County, Indiana. These and this county are right next to Chicago, Illinois, so we’re less than 25 minutes away from the [Illinois-Indiana] border and less than an hour’s drive away from Chicago in Illinois. I am white; that’s my ethnicity. I have, I guess … I go to a public school, so that’s where I get my education. I am active in the theatre there; I love, um, French. I speak that a little; I’m still in high school, so I don’t speak it fluently. I can say a few things. From those two things, theatre and French, I’ve learned a lot about enunciation and annoying little nuances in my culture’s language because, around here, there’s a humongous diversity among people. There is the Chicago accent. There’s the southern accent of southern Indiana. There’s this northwestern Indiana accent, which is very nasally, but I have never really had an occupation, really. I’ve been focusing mostly on my high school, and I try to keep grades up. That’s a real focus and also theatre. Theatre is one of the very monumental focuses in my life, and I plan on making that a large part of my life. I want to become an actor, so I really think that might have an effect on my enunciation because I’ve become aware of all the nuances in the area, the slurred words and nasal accents, and that’s basically it.
