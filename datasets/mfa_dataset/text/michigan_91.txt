I was born in L’Anse, Michigan, in the upper peninsula of Michigan, um, about four-hundred, about two-hundred miles north of Green Bay, um, by Dr. Strobe, to my parents, on June second, nineteen seventy-two. Lived there until I was, uh, what, about 12 years old. Then I moved to Ishpeming, Michigan, where I lived there for the rest of the time until I graduated from high school. Shortly after that, uh, joined the army. Went in the basic training in Jackson, South Carolina, Fort Jackson, South Carolina. Um, then, from there, went to A.I.T. in, uh, Fort Sam Houston, to be a ninety-one bravo. I was a ninety-one bravo. I was a medic. Uh, from there, went to Korea. Was in Korea for a year, and … good time there. Um, was just real glad to get back ‘cause I was just, like, culture shock, even just coming back here, then, uh, after that went to Denver. Stayed there for about, uh, three years. And, while I was there, I decided to advance my medical training, and went to LPN school. Uh, there I went back to Fort Sanford, for six weeks, for phase one, then phase two, and pretty soon I went back to Denver. It was, uh, Fitzsimmons Army Medical Center, at the time, but they closed that due to one of the RAC realignments about ten years ag., Um, then, did that, got my LPN license, moved to Tacoma, Washington, Fort Lewis. Um, was there for about another three years. Started off in just a general med-surg. ward, but I lucked out, and S.C.U. needed a, a LPN in that area, so, got the opportunity to go there, so, um, I went there. Happy as hell. Uh, got out [of] the army, came back here to Houghton, Michigan. I was goin’ to school; uh, met my wife online, opened up my wonderful coffee shop. Uh, and that’s it.
