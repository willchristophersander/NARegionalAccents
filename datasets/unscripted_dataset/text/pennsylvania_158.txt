I was born in Uniontown, Pennsylvania, which is in [the] southwestern part of the state, but I was raised in the southeastern part of Pennsylvania, outside of Philadelphia. [I] went to Clifton Heights High School. I’ve been in the U.S. Air Force as a medic; I’ve, uh, worked as a mechanic in garages; I’ve been a steel worker for twenty six years, and I’ve been a maintenance worker at, uh, Swarthmore College for the past eight and a half years. I was a millwright mechanic and a crane mechanic and inspector. Uh, we made, uh, products of (sheet steel products) uh, which [are] used for a variety of appliances, automobiles, structural materials. And I’ve [clears throat] worked on all types of machinery, uh, pumps, motors, um, rolling mills, temper mills, furnaces. Did welding, uh, machine shop operations and, uh, my father was a, uh, had a automobile garage, and we did some machine work there rebuilding engines, transmissions, every, every, every mechanical component on a car and, uh, so the job opportunity came to me to work in a steel plant, and, uh, working on much bigger machinery. Uh, eventually I wound up being the crane mechanic [that] took care of forty-five cranes and hoists for the plant. They had about eight hundred workers there. Uh, [the] steel plant closed along with other, other plants and, uh, found work at the co- where – the community where I live, as a maintenance mechanic. And my primary job duties there are, uh, heating, air conditioning, and ventilation systems, but I also do plumbing and any other needed repairs or adjustments.
