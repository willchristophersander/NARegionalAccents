I was born in Grenada County, six twenty six thirty seven. I started out workin’ with my father, and later I start workin’ for the Coca-Cola Bottle Company in Grenada. And I worked there, ‘bout seventeen, eighteen year, and, uh, they closed down and I drove cab awhile. Then I went to Rockwell International and worked there about sixteen years in Rockwell. I got laid off at Rockwell, and I drove cab awhile and I went to the police department; worked there as a jailer for three-and-a-half year. And I, I was sick when I left there cause the job had closed down and I — so I got a security job and worked, just talking two year, about a year-and-a-half, and so I retired. And so now I’m here at home, tryin’ t’ enjoy life, just take things as they come. They’d be goin’ — they’d be goin’ to the field, me n’ brother had never went to the field before, and we slipped off and went to, went to the field I don’t know, we were picking cotton or hoeing cotton. And the first day we slipped off and went, the man had a breakdown, we ten o’clock get home that night. [Laughs] I, I never forget that old man; he stay over in Charleston now. Old man Ham Luke. I think he in Memphis now, and, um, all the kids’d love be around him cause, you know, he was, he was, he was real nice, you know, he, he was a real nice old man, you know, he talked cotton shop and, uh, cotton pickers and things. And me and my brother had never went and I borrowed, and he, he, he workin’ hard and he wasn’t goin’ to give us no money. And I mean, you know, he buy, you know, we had what we need but cash money we didn’t had that; we wanted money to put in our own pockets; we still went to the fields make us some money.
