I was born in Sikeston, Missouri, and it is the bootheel, of course. Um, it’s a small town. It’s — has sixteen-thousand. But, uh, well, I say it’s a small town. Sixteen-thousand doesn’t sound like it’s that small, but everybody knows everybody. And, um, you know everybody’s history and it’s kind of nice. I like it. Um, there’s not really anything to do there. There are three big restaurants: Applebee’s, that kind of thing, um, if you want to go out to eat. If you want to do something else, there’s a little bitty movie theater and a bowling alley. Other than that, um, I grew up with my friends just doing things outside. We were always — everybody’s outside. And you ride four-wheelers, go, uh, fishing, hunting, um, go to somebody’s farm. It — that’s what everybody does. That’s what I was doing this weekend, actually. So, um, if you actually want to do something, you might drive to Cape [Girardeau], which is thirty minutes north. And, you know, I don’t know, there’s a little more to do — bigger movie theater [laughter] and a few more restaurants. Um, that’s about all there is to do around Sikeston-Cape area, the bootheel.
