I was born and raised just north of Seattle, in Richmond Beach, which is now part of Shoreline, Washington. My mother was also born and raised in the Seattle area, and my father was born in Eastern Washington but grew up in the Seattle area. I spent three years in Olympia, Washington, going to college, and Iâ€™ve spent the last 14 years living in the western suburbs of Portland, Oregon, including Beaverton, Aloha, and Hillsboro.
