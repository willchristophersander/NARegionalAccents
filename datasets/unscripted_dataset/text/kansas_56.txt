I was born in Sacramento, California. My father was in the Air Force until I was 19. At the age of three months, we moved to Topeka, Kansas, where I lived until I was 10. After that, we’ve moved around a bunch of places, none for very long. [As a child] I’ve lived in central Texas, [at] an Air Force base in Japan; as an adult, I’ve lived in Atlanta, I’ve lived in Texas since 1988 — but I think it’s in Topeka that I got the accent that I have. Now, I found the International Dialects of English Archive when I was reading the book “1634: The Baltic War” by Eric Flint, and a running joke in that book is about the strangeness of the West Virginia accents. I got curious what a West Virginia accent was; I found this Website, and I was able to assuage my curiosity. I got really excited about this site because I’m writing a book, and I need to know something about English accents. (I’ve never been to England.) So, I went over to the England section, and found the sixty-three English accents, and listened to them. The only ones I knew before were a Cockney accent, and the only other one that I knew about was “Received Pronunciation.” The term Received Pronunciation confuses me. Why is it called that? I sure as heck haven’t received it! Was it lost in the mail? So anyway, I’ve had great fun listening to the International Dialects of English Archive, and I think I should be placed in its “Kansas” section.
