I was born in Houston, Texas, in Northwest Medical Hospital. When I was two weeks old, my family moved to Riverside, Texas, about thirty miles from Huntsville, East Texas. I am 20. I have a younger brother who is 16. Both of my parents are still married, and I have all my grandparents still alive except my dad’s father. No, they live in Lake Rhinestone, Houston, and Texas. And I see them for holidays, and if I have a chance on college break I go and see them. Sam Houston State University in Texas. Accounting: majoring in accounting, minoring in business. As of right now I am hoping to go back for a master’s, and then I hope to go to work for some CPA, get enough hours to sit for your CPA. My boyfriend races dirt track cars and so does my little brother. Dirt track cars. They’re race cars that race on oval dirt tracks. Every Saturday night.
