I grew up in Baltimore, Maryland. I lived in the city when I was younger, and then I moved to the county when I was about 9 years old. Um, my parents were divorced, and they both remarried when I was 2, so I grew up having two sets of parents, unlike other children who only had one. So I consider myself very fortunate because all my parents loved me. I had a brother by my father and stepmother, and I had a sister by my mother and stepfather, and, um, when I was 17 years old I was with my girlfriend in the car we went to one of these drive-in, um, um, um, food places where they like, ya know, come out and take your order and put the thing on the side of the car, ya know very fifties, but it was actually in 1964, and, um, all of a sudden this car pulled in beside us and there were these two really cute guys in there and, and one asked me my name, and I told him it was Jackie, and I said, “What’s yours?” and he goes K Knoreline, and I almost threw up in the back of my throat, but then he said he was just kidding so we, um, started talking. He asked me to go on a date, and we’ve been together ever since. That was forty-three years ago August the seventh. Let me see, what else? Have I traveled a lot? Well, we lived a lot of places when I was growing up; my dad lived all over the East Coast, so of course I spent summers and whenever I could with him, and I would never move out and, and after were married my husband went into the Navy during Vietnam and we did some traveling into Dallas, and we moved to San Diego, California, for two-and-a-half years. Um, so ya, we traveled around quite a bit. We’ve been a lot of places on the East Coast, um, some that we frequent, like Cape Cod, and, um, ya know last summer we took a trip out west, and we did some remote to Phoenix and stopped in a lot of wonderful places and went back to San Diego, where we lived when my husband was in the service.
