I’m 23 years old. I was born in Harrison, Arkansas, and — January 3rd of 1978. My parents are both from Harrison. And, uh, I have two older brothers, both married. I grew up in Harrison and went to school there. I never moved until I came to college, um, after I graduated high school in 1976. I’d never been out of — I’d always had the same bedroom until then, so, it was quite a change to move just an hour and a half west of there. Um, I go to school at the University of Arkansas. I’m a drama major and a Spanish minor. I’ll be graduating in May, and I hope to do theater work. I’d like to be paid to act, in some capacity. Um, what else about my family? I, uh, my father is a retired politician. My parents both retired, just this past December; after serving as, uh, the county clerk and the deputy clerk for, uh, 24 years. And my father also owns a farm, where he raises beef cattle. So, trips to the farm were a fun thing, when I was younger. That’s where we went and got our Christmas trees. And, um, I would pick them out, and my dad would cut them down. And, we would bring them home and my mother would complain that they were too big. Because they always look a lot taller in the field than they do when you get them in the house. And so they would double over on the ceiling and we would have to cut the top out or something. And so, she gave us the rule that we could never get any trees taller than my father was. But … so that’s one of my memories, from growing up, and the farm. And getting to feed baby cattle, from out of the bottle, things like that.
