Well, I was born in St. Louis, Missouri, um, September 9th, 1981, and, um, I was born at a hospital that my father actually worked at. And, um, he delivers babies, but he did not deliver me. Uh, it’s against the law, at that time. Um, and, uh, I have an older sister, Ashley, who is two-and-a-half years older than me. Early childhood, um, we lived in a neighborhood that was very, uh, close-knit. All the neighbors were comfortable, and sociable with everyone, and we lived across the street from, uh, good family friends, and my older sister and one of their daughters across the street, uh, were close friends. And, uh, they used to yell across the street to each other, when they were just toddlers. My sister, Ashley, would yell over at Christy, “Kiki, Kiki!” And Christy would yell back at Ashley, “Ya, ya! Ya, ya!” Um, an’ I remember hearing from my mom — it’s one of her favorite stories, she used to tell — uh, when she brought me home from the hospital, my sister looked at me. My mom said, you know, “Here’s your new sister,” in this kind of grand introduction, and my sister looked at me and, took a moment, and then said, “OK. Can I go play outside now?”
