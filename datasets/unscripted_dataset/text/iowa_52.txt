I’m from a small town in northwest Iowa. There’s not really a lot to do there. We just hung out with our friends, and, there wasn’t really a lot to do, but we had the … fun. Um, everyone pretty much knows everyone; it’s a pretty small, tight-knit community. There’s lots of cornfields, and animals, and farms. So, a lot of my friends lived on farms, but I lived in town. Um, I don’t know what else to say, but uh, that’s it!
