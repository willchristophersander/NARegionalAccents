I was born in East Orange, New Jersey. I’ve lived most of my life on the East Coast, going up as far as Maine, which was a … an experience. I love the Jersey shore. I’ve spent a lot of time at the Jersey shore and find it very refreshing, but, as I like to say, we’re the real Jersey shore, not the MTV Jersey shore. I have two daughters, and they live in West Virginia. I spend most of my time with my dogs, who [sic] I’m very fond of. They are my little babies; I call them my shadows. And we have a wonderful life here at the Jersey shore.
