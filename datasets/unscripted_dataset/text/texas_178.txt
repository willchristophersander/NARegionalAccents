And in regards to me, I am … I was born in eastern New Mexico, a town called Portales. Um, it’s not too far off from another, a larger town, Clovis, New Mexico, which is where my mom was born and raised; um, still have family there. My father is from Anniston, Alabama, um, though-even though I was born in New Mexico, we didn’t stay there long. Uh, before I even turned 1, uh, we moved to Lubbock, Texas, which is West Texas, and still not too far away from Clovis, the Clovis area. Uh, I lived there till I was 12, and then moved to the Dallas area where I’ve been ever since. And, um, I, I guess that’s all in regards to my accent, uh, I could say it; the reason I’m doing this is because so often I have people ask me, uh, where I’m from; uh, apparently, uh, my accent doesn’t sound like I’m from Texas or, I don’t know, maybe it might be the western region of it. But, um, whenever I ask them where they think I’m from, they can never give a distinct answer. So it, it’s always been something that’s really intrigued me. Um, I’d really like to find out, uh, ’cause it bothers me a lot. Um, so I’m hoping this’ll give me a good analysis, and I look forward to seeing it on the Website and helping the IDEA archives out. I think that is about all I have to say though, so I will stop now.
