I’m from New Orleans … grew up in Gentilly … ummmmm …. one of eleven boys. Uhhhhhh, we had fights all the time … uh, product of a Catholic school education … uhhhhh … grammar school, high school, college – University of New Orleans. Uhhhhhm, what else? I’m a banker, and I barely make a living doing that. But it’s fun work. I live in Covington, Louisiana, which is about 35 miles north of New Orleans on the north shore of Lake Ponchartrain. Uhhhhh, we came home from a very long trip to San Diego to see my brother Stephen graduate from the Naval Academy, or we visited him, and we all piled into a station wagon, 1958 Chevrolet station wagon. When we got home, everybody was so tired we all broke into a giant fist fight. We were fed up with being around each other; and my father terminated fight with several slaps on the top of the head, with my mother yelling at us, and we all went to bed exhausted.
