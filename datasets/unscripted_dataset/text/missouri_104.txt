And I grew up in Kimberling City, Missouri. It’s close to Branson, usually the only city people know about down there. And, uh, I used to work at the Hard Luck Diner, which is part of Stuart Owner’s City [unclear], that was like the biggest part of the city … was this old, you know, cave. They built an amusement park around it. And, uh, I danced for a long time, like 13 years. I used to teach dance classes. I really liked the kids, so I had fun with that. And then I came to Kansas City, and … to come to college. I’m here; should I say the name of my school? UM … I’m here at UMKC, and, uh, it’s a lot of fun, although, uh, for some reason I seem to have trouble: I’m wondering, I’m wondering if I’m in the right major. Sometimes I think I want to change to something else, but I think I’m in the right spot because I want to be a director. I want to direct music videos and maybe do some film, but they don’t have a film major here. So, I’m minoring in that, and, uh, this is the closest I can get in theatre … wanted to direct, wanted to act, so I think I’ll be OK … learn how to talk properly and [laughs] breathe properly, and I don’t have much else to say about myself.
