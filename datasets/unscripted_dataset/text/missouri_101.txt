Um, I grew up in Kansas City. I was … I grew up in in a fairly metropolitan part of the city, and I lived there until I was about 10 years old. We lived across the street from the park, and every day on the way to a small private school that I went to we had to drive through the Plaza, which was a main shopping center in Kansas City, Missouri, when in Christmastime is lit up with thousands of different-colored lights. It’s ve-very, very beautiful, and sometimes we’d have to leave very early in the morning to get to school and lights would still be on. Um, when I was about 10, we moved to a suburb in Kansas called Stilwell, Kansas. It was a very small town, and I went to a very large school, so‘s a very different switch from a huge town and a small school to a small town and a big school. Um, I lived there till I went to college, and I went to college first at Emporia, Kansas, a four-year university, and transferred then to the University of Kansas, which is a bigger four-year university, and I expect to graduate this May. Just tonight I got an e-mail from the set designer of a show I was in last last spring called “Ramona Quimby.” The set designer had dec-decided that in the last scene, the Whopper Burger scene, where the Ramona Quimby family goes to the Whopper Burger that the big set piece would be a humongous hamburger that’s dropped from the top of the set, and the theme was a construction theme, so it was dropped in on this big crane, and he sent me this e-mail of a Website of what happened to that big hamburger after the show was over, and he took pictures of it in various places. They hung it off of the top of Murphy Hall, which is the hall the theatre’s in, and then they they left it on the side of the building, and it snowed on it and he had just basically pictures of it everywhere. And then he took pictures of like Paris and New York and and somehow imposed the hamburger in these places, and it was pretty funny.
