OK, I live in Addison, Illinois, which is a northwest suburb of Chicago. And, uh, a story from when I was little: Um, we used to live in my grandparent’s old house. They were, my grandpa was, moved, they moved to Saudi Arabia, my grandpa worked for, um, I can’t think of the name right now, but, some company, and he lived there for four years, and so we lived in their house and they had … it was the house that they lived in for, like, ever, they built it with their … that was their house and everything; they had five kids. And, me and my mom and my dad and … no, my little sister didn’t live there yet ’cause she wasn’t born. And it was in, like, at the back of a cul-de-sac, and down the street lived my two best friends, Charlie and Danny. And Charlie was my boyfriend, and I was only 3, so he was my first boyfriend. And his brother Danny wasn’t my age; he was an older man; he was two years older than I was: He was 5. And we used to play “Star Wars,” ’cause that was our favorite movie, and we used to watch it all the time, and we’d only seen the first one. So me and Charlie were, um, Luke ‘n’ Leia, because they were supposedly together. But then we found out, after we had been playing Luke ‘n’ Leia were together that Luke and Leia were twins, so we couldn’t be little boyfriend and girlfriend any more as Luke and Leia, because they were brother and sister.
