OK, I was born in Hartford, Connecticut, and, until age 4 we lived, um, in a three-family on Kent Street in Hartford, Connecticut, and then when I was 4 years old, we moved to West Hartford, uh, where I attended elementary school, um, w-within walking distance of my home, and then junior high school also within walking or bike difference from my home, um, and thereafter, uh, the old William H. Hall High School, uh, in West Hartford Center, which was, uh, more difficult to get to. I can’t remember how I got there before I had th-the use of a motor vehicle; I can’t remember whether I walked or rode a bike or how, frankly. I went to Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire, and then I went to Columbia Law School in New York City, um, and then after that, for three years, and then after that to NYU Graduate School, um, of Law, where I got an LLM in taxation. Then I came back to Hartford to practice law. My family’s always lived in Connecticut to the best of m – no, I’ll take that back, my father was born in Philadelphia, um, and uh, when he married my mother, who was, a Connecticut lady from an immigrant family, um, and she lived uh, in her younger days, she lived on a plantation, a tobacco plantation, in the, er Ellington, Vernon area of Connecticut. Um, and then uh, when she and my father married, they lived in Hartford, as I say, on Kent Street. The uh, rest of my father’s family are always Philadelphia people, um, they always, uh, spoke with a pronounced Philadelphia accent. My father, however, I never heard any accent at-at-at-at all. Um, eh, to my ear, it never sounded as if he had a Philadelphia accent, whatsoever.
