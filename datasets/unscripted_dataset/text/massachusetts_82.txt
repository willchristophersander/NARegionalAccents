I was born in South Boston, and … in 1977. I think right after the time of busing, and that was a time when there were not a lot of people in South Boston who were not from here. Um, it was a very family-oriented town, and everybody had a strong accent, in which they didn’t pronounce their Rs. So, um, that was very normal for me growing up. I grew up in a single-family home, um, raised by my mother, who worked a lot of jobs to support us. And, um, and I went to college here at Boston University, um, with a very diverse crowd of people. I then took two years off. I traveled around a place. I worked in Mexico, and I bartendered here and there. Then I went to grad school in Indiana. I went to Indiana University of Bloomington for two years, to get my master’s in Speech Therapy. Um, I am now a speech therapist working in the Lynn public schools, which is a city right outside of Boston. Um, I, I have a special spot for my Southie accent, which comes out, um, here and there when I’m hangin’ out with my old Southie crew, or when I’ve had a couple cocktails. However, I think that, when I went to Indiana University, um, and maybe even a little bit before that, when I was working in a, a touristy section of Mexico, um, I just got really frustrated with the stigma that I feel like the South Boston accent brought on. Um, I think a lot of people, um, give you a bit of a stereotype. Um, with the accent, people love to make fun of it. People constantly want you to tell them that “you pahked yah cah in Hah-vahd Yahd.” You know, and they, they just think it’s great, whereas we just kinda think it’s our normal speech, not anything too funny about it for us. But I, I guess I really just got sick of people makin’ fun of the accent, so I think I, I did a bit of code switchin’ and I developed more of a standard American, standard American accent. And, um, that is what I generally use, although I — like I said — I switch back and forth.
