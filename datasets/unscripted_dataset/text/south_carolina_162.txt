OK, I was raised in, uh, Leesville, South Carolina, out in the country. It was, the name of the place was Ridge Road. And we, I went to Ridge Road School in, in grammar school; they had a big room and a little room. You know, you don’t hear tell of that now. I was born out the country, with three brothers and two sisters and my mom and daddy, and he bought a, he bought a, when I must have been about 8, 9 years old, we lived in a rented house. Well, daddy decided he’s going to buy him a farm, so he bought a 60-acre farm not too far from where we, uh, lived. And I helped hoe and pick cotton [laughs], oh my goodness, and when I got 18 years old then finished high school, I, I left. I didn’t have to do that anymore, but um, that’s just the way they did back then. The children, they had children so they could work in the field and all. That sounds silly, doesn’t it? But I tell you, my mom and dad was really good to us though. I, I have friends say that they went hungry, they didn’t have food to eat, or anything hardly to wear, we always had nice clothes, we always had food to eat, anytime, anything we wanted, we had it. And I never had to, um … [Interviewer: “This was during the Depression, wasn’t it?”] Yeah, it was. And you know, people had to, uh, people went around to the really the people that didn’t have food and stuff, and give them food and stuff. But, praise the Lord, we never did have to get it. Because we, uh, farmed and mama canned a lot. She’d, it’d, now they freeze it and everything. Well, she started freezing it before she passed away. We had just about everything, you know, we need — we had everything we needed out there. And, uh, and, it, it was really nice. And then I came to Columbia when I was 18 years old, and of course whenever my husband was in service, I traveled around with him some.
