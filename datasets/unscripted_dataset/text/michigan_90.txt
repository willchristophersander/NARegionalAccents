OK, so, um, I was actually born and raised in Grand Rapids, Michigan. I lived there ‘til I was about, uh, 23 years old. Both of my parents were from Michigan. Um, a lot of my ancestors were actually all from the Netherlands, so very predominantly Dutch genes that I have, uh; a little bit of French, but all of my great-grandparents came over from the Netherlands, and they settled some in, um, western Michigan and some in Wisconsin. And, uh, that’s where most of my family still is. I lived in western Michigan until I was 23 years old. And then I moved down to Columbus, Ohio. So, not very far away, but there you go, it’s right there. Um, tsk, in terms of my education, I’m working on a dissertation. I only have less than one year left. And I’m writing actually on British theatre history and, uh, the influences by German theatre history, so, uh, someday I hope to be a professor somewhere at a small college, um, somewhere in the Midwest; that’s kind of where my heart is, because I grew up around here.
