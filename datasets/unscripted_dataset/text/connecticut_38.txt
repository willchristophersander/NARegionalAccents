So I was born, raised, and grew up in Hartford Connecticut. Um, my mother was from Hartford, Connecticut; my father was from Springfield Massachusetts, but he moved here when he was 35, and lived here till almost 89. I went to — all through school here. I graduated Weaver High School, um, and, I went to, dental hygiene school for two years, in Boston; I came home, to Hartford, went to work, got married, and stayed here. My mother’s family had been here a long time, um, my grandfather, her father, was, um, the first independent milkman in Hartford, and her brother, one of her brothers worked with him, um, they used to go to the farm, get the milk, um, bring it back to their backyard, where they had a shed, bigger than a shed, but, a plant, and, they’d pasteurize it, put it in bottles, and then, he’d go out and deliver it. I actually was in elective public office for eighteen years; I did, eight years on my school board, the Bloomfield Board of Education, and ten years in the Connecticut General Assembly, um, where you ran for re-election every two years. I was, the co-chair of the Education Committee for four years; I was the Deputy Majority Leader for two years; I was, uh, in addition to the legislative committees, I just happened to be there at the right time, so I was on a number of national boards. I was at one point the chair, in 1999—1, 1991, of the Women’s Network of the National Conference of State Legislatures, so there were fifteen-hundred elected women reps in the United States. We developed policy papers, for model legislation in states; we did leadership training; we, tried to, move the male-dominated organizational structure of NCSL toward more human services kinds of issues. It was exciting time.
