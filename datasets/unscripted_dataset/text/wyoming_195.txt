Um, I’m originally from uh, Basin, Wyoming, uh, is where I was raised and grew up. Uh, this, this story actually kind of caught my eye, my dad is uh, a veterinarian and, and uh did a lot of work, actually, with, with foot-and-mouth disease, so that, uh, that kind of uh rings, wings, rings true to what I grew up with. Um, I grew up in Basin, Wyoming; uh, I was, was active there. It’s a small town of about 1000 people. Uh, went to high school there, um and then went on to college at the University of Wyoming. Uh, while there I studied actually thinking about going to medical school; instead decided to be a lawyer, so I went on to law school and, and, uh now I’m a practicing lawyer. Um, I’m been married about a year. Uh, My wife and I: Uh, she’s also a lawyer. Uh, we enjoy, uh, lots of different things but, uh, this weekend we’re actually gonna go camping. Um, and, actually hiking up into the Big Horn Mountains. Uh, the hike’s up into what’s called Lake Sawtooth and the Cloud Peak wilderness. Uh, should be a lot of fun, uh, but, uh, up there you can’t, uh, use any kinds of uh, fires or or that sort of thing; you have to, have to use the little backpacking hitchhiker’s, uh, uh, fire stoves and everything, so we can’t cut any wood or, or that sort of thing. Um, I enjoy also too road biking as well as, um, I enjoy pretty much any kind of sports activities. Um, and also though too I do enjoy theatre. I, I have tried out for a couple of theatre productions here in Sheridan as well as, um, as well as I enjoy going to the theatre uh, with my wife. We go to a lot of plays and performances, uh, and yeah I’m glad to help out, uh, with this project.
