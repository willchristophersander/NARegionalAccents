All right. I was born in Cheboygan, Michigan, um, at the age of zero [laughs]. Um, lived there my entire life. Um, when I was in the fourth grade we moved, um, on the other side of the county, still in Cheboygan; still went to Cheboygan schools. Um, graduated high school, in Cheboygan. Um, went to, um, Michigan Tech University, college, which is in Houghton, Michigan [clears throat], um, which is about a five-hour drive from Cheboygan, in good weather. Um, was at Michigan Tech for a little over four years. Uh, met the woman I married [at] Michigan Tech, and then we moved back, um, to Cheboygan. I, I had found a job at a company, right in my hometown, um, doing, uh, embedded systems programming for automotive test equipment, and I guess I worked there for about, uh, six-and-a-half or seven years, then decided to make a career change. Um, looked around at different places and, uh, there wasn’t really anything in my hometown doing what I wanted to do so we looked up here, which is, uh, my wife’s hometown, this area, and, uh, so I applied at, uh, different businesses, and Michigan Tech University, and Finlandia University [clears throat], um, ended up, uh, interviewing at both universities and then accepted an offer at Michigan Tech. Been at the university, now, a little over nine years and, um, got suckered into doing an interview. [Laughs] Um, wait. Where do I go from here? So I been, uh, married almost sixteen years and, um, we have, uh, ten kids right now and our oldest, she’s 14 and a half.
