Oh! That’s it; um, I grew up in Fair Grove, Missouri, and I’ve lived in the same place, uh, like all the way growing up. And, uh, my parents are originally from Salina, Kansas. And I don’t know if that discredits this accent or not, but, um, it’s, it, you know, they lived there for quite a while before I was born. And, um, my parents are involved in the, the, the Historical and Preservation Society of the town, and when I was a kid we had a lot of animals. We had, um, pigs and chickens and, um, mules and draft horses and things like that, which is, um, odd since we lived in the middle of town, you know, which I guess says how small the town was. The population, uh, growing up was in the mid-600s, um 640-something, I think, and now it’s, um, 919. Um, it’s a … it’s a small town just outside of Springfield, Missouri, and we, we used to go shop in Springfield and get everything, get everything there because there wasn’t, um, there weren’t many shops in Fair Grove.
