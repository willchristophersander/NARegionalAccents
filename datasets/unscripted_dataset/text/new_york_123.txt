I was born in New York City, um, actually North Harlem, but spent almost my entire formative years in the south Bronx, and we actually lived between Yankee stadium and the Polo Grounds. Now I realize that most of you who will listen to this tape will have no idea what the Polo Grounds were. The Polo Grounds were a field, an athletic field, a professional-athletic field where the New York football Giants and the New York baseball Giants played. Living between these two stadiums was fabulous because that meant that any day that I didn’t feel like going to school, which amounted to many days, especially during the football and baseball seasons, I had a choice of either going to watch the Yankees Baseball team, the Yankees Football team, the Giants Baseball team or the Giants Football team, in person. Now back in those days, I know you won’t believe this, but back in those days, you could actually go to the ball park about the sixth inning and the turnstiles would be left unattended. So that means that you could get up to the general admission turnstiles; there would be nobody there to watch; you could sneak under, over or around these turnstiles, get into the ball park and watch the last three or four innings of most every game.
