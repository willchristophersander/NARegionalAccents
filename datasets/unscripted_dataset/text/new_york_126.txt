… from Smithtown, New York. It’s on Long Island, on the North Shore, about 50 miles. It’s off of the, uh, Port Jeff line. That’s how most people know Long Island, by the train line, the Long Island Railroad. Well I grew up there, and I left when I went to college. So, about 18, I guess. Up in Binghamton, New York. I’ve lived, I guess in Manhattan, and a little bit in — a short time in Germantown, but no other states. Yep, I live in Queens, in Astoria. All right, well, one time I was in, uh, Italy, and I had to use — I had to use a toilet very badly, so I went to, um, I asked this guy — It was in Venice — and I asked this guy, uh, if I could use, if he knew of where a public toilet was, and he — we couldn’t communicate at all. He spoke heavy Italian, uh, no English; I didn’t speak any Italian. So he led me to his workshop, a basement, where he offered me a jar. [Laughs] And, and I couldn’t do it, because I was too embarrassed. So, I left, and still had to use the bathroom.
