I live in Merrimack, New Hampshire. I have been here for almost 20 years. I’ve been married for almost 20 years. I have two teenage daughters, which is one of the most trying things I have ever tried to do, live and survive in this atmosphere. Uh, I’m a teacher, Special Ed. teacher. I work with, um, 5- and 6-year olds, and I’ve been doing that for … hmmm, this is my fourteenth year. I’ve been teaching special-needs children for 22 years. And I love it.

I have big plans for the doctor; Dr. Science, I’ve already talked to you about that. That’s a goal of mine, to spread the word and make some money. That would be sweet. Um, I’m taking saxophone lessons for a year and a half, and I’m much better than I was a year ago. I really love to play the saxophone. I won’t play that for you now, though, so that’ll be a good thing. Oh, photography! I’ve been shootin’ pictures for a year and a half, mostly color, and, um … I haven’t done black-and-whites yet, but I’m — I’ve got some pretty good luck with the color shots.
