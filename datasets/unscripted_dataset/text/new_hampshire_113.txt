I live in New Hampshire, in Merrimack, an’ I like it,’cause it, like, it snows here an’ you … There’s a lotta skiing places. An’ it’s fun. [laughs, whispering] So that — should I just go there? My family: I have one sister, an’ her name’s Caitlyn. An’ a mom an’ a dad, an’ they’re both teachers, an’ my mom loves to go skiing an’ my dad loves to go fishing. And, um, I’m in middle school. I still go to middle school, an’ I love school because I see my friends, an’ there’s school dances. That’s fun. An’ the sports I do — I — do a lot, actually. I do soccer, basketball, I horseback ride, an’ I dance, so, tat’s fun. An’ my favorite foods — that’s a lot. I like pizza, an’ grilled cheese, an’ macaroni an’ cheese. Those are my favorites. An’ then, cheddar cheese. An’ my plans for the future? I wanna be, um, either a writer or a kindergarten teacher, like my mom. So [clears throat], an’ I wanna have a family of my own. Pretty much what I wanna do with my life.
