I was born in Cañon City. Um, during that time, uh, my folks had sheep, so my dad didn’t get down to the hospital to see me for quite a while. And so I — every year on my birthday we were shearing sheep it seemed like, ’til I was in high school. And growing up we got to ride horses a lot, um, worked in the hay field; uh, we were in 4H, so that kept us busy during the summer. Um, my, um, class — I st — went to school in Westcliffe from — we didn’t have kindergarten, but first grade through twelfth all here. And there was about 24 graduated with us. Um, I got married out of high school, have three boys and seven grandkids. And so that kept me busy. My, um, when — I had two grandkids live with me. And my mom — um, she want — the boy to co — he’ll — he just graduated this year. So now it’s just Mom and I in the house. And we like to go mess around, go to Cripple Creek and gamble. And she would like to travel more. So we just keep busy on the ranch. Um, things have changed some around here, but really it doesn’t seem to grow a lot. There are a lot of new people. Growing up we knew everyone. And, um, now we don’t. But it still doesn’t seem like it’s growing — probably in the mountains around, but the cities — Westcliffe still stays the same.
