I was born in Delavan, Illinois, rather in the country close to Delavan, Illinois. Um, born in a farmhouse; um, the doctor was there; um, my father was a farmer, he was a tenant farmer, eh, farmed about 180 acres and we had sort of a, a struggle to make ends meet usually. I went to grade school and high school in Delavan, Illinois, and then went on to Illinois State University in Normal. I majored in, uh, speech therapy, we called it at that time, and, uh, worked as a public-school speech therapist for nine and a half years after graduating from Illinois State. Um, I’m al- I’ve also been a piano teacher at a couple different times and have played organ for church, a couple different, uh, towns and most recently worked as a clerical person at Metropolitan Life Insurance Company. Did that for quite a few years and recently have retired from that position. Um, I enjoy sewing, and reading, and traveling, and cooking, and being with friends uh. [I] have one child and one grandchild that I enjoy a great deal. In central Illinois it’s pretty flat, very few hills or valleys, um, a few drainage ditches going through the farm country um, lot of — this time of year in the summer there’s a lot of, ah, corn fields that get quite tall with green corn uh, wheat, beans, oats are raised in that area, um, some cattle — milk cows and, uh, beef cattle as well, um, little, little towns, lot of farms dotting the countryside.
