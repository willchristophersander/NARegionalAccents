I was, um, born and raised in Springfield, Missouri, which is three hours south of Kansas City. And I, uh, lived there for 18 years, and then I moved to Kansas City, and I went to the K of C Art Institute for four years, an’ then I went down the street to U. of K.C., and I’ve been there for three. There’s a lotta golf courses, an’ a lotta country clubs. People are big on that. Um, fishing, we’re the home o’ the Bass Pro. Um, not very much, ’cause I’m very busy. This is my last year, so, I think I’ve been home maybe four times this year. I’m gonna go home this weekend though. Yeah, I’ve had a change in my accent. Whenever I go home, I notice my dad has a really bad one. He says warsh, an’ fahr, stuff like that, so, I definitely notice it when I go home. An’ Adam, Pascali, makes fun of me a lot, ’cause he says, like, peelow or pellow. I say pillow. Yeah, I know, that’s little things, but I don’t think that I have a really significant accent, as, uh, some of my family does.
