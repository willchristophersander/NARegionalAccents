OK, um, I was born here in Arizona, and my parents, they’re from Michoacán, Mexico. I’ve lived twenty, well, basically my whole life in Wittmann, Arizona, which is far, far away from here, from Tempe. I think 56 miles. You know, I go here, to Arizona State University. I’ve noticed that there’s not that many Mexican people around here. It’s predominantly white, which is OK; you know, it’s all right. But there’s a lack of Latinos here, and, you know, it’s just something that I’ve noticed. I mean compared to other places I guess there’s not that many. I’m studying, I’m in, my major is Justice Studies. You know, I’m learning a lot about the movement, and reading all those books about acting and everything like that. And it’s really interesting I guess to correlate both theatre and Justice Studies just because there’s so many forms, or you can use theatre in different ways to, I guess, to get across the message of change and everything. So, uh, yeah. I remember back in the day when I was little and everything I just remember, because my birthday is on Christmas so it kind of sucked, because, well, since my birthday’s on Christmas and everything, you only get one present. So, you know, I guess like, with my family and everything it really sucks. You know? Like, yeah. Um, we always opened I guess, like, we always opened up our presents on Christmas Eve night. My mom would make like, how you say, she’d make La Abuelita chocolate, which tastes really good. Yeah, it’s really good. She like makes it by hand and everything. I don’t know, like, I kind of miss it.
