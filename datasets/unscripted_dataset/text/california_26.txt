I lived in Mission Viejo for 18 years, and that’s in southern Orange County. Um, and for the past three years, I’ve been living in San Juan Capistrano. And, um, It’s a little different, I think, ’cause it’s closer to the beach. Um, I work at a bank, which is near the beach. And I, I observe a lot of people coming in, and talking to them, and they have a, a lazy way of talking, I’d say. Um, the beach bum’s kind of … it’s a … so it’s interesting working near it, talking to people, communicating, and hearing different types of dialects. Um, I think it’s a more, a lazier way of speaking, down here, um, compared to, I’d say, Eastern or Midwestern accents. Um, I think that they pronounce consonants more. We just kind of let it flow.
