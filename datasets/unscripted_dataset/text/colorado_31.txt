I was born in Rocky Ford, Colorado. Uh, but my folks just went there. We’ve lived h–here in Custer County most of our lives on a ranch and, uh, south of Westcliffe. It’s, uh, we’ve li– when we was first born we, uh, it was in the time when the Depression was going on and so things were a little rough. But, uh, we had a good life. Uh, we used to, of course, use horses to put up the hay and sowing like that, ride to school and either walked or, or s– rode horses or went in a buggy even. And then gradually, we got lights and telephone and more modern. Uh, I went to a one-room school with eight grades. Uh, we, ‘course there was only about 17 pupils in the whole school, average. And so some grades there wasn’t a pupil there. Uh, we, my folks had a few sheep and, and cows. Uh, so we — there were just three girls, so we learned to work in the fields as well as, as help in the house some. Always, we milked quite a few cows. And, uh, I — would have to milk cows before I went to school. And, uh, so you milked cows and then you changed into your school clothes, and when you got home you changed back into chore clothes before you went and milked and fed the pigs and the chickens and brought in the wood and things like that.
