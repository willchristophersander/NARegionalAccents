When I was growing up in Bartlesville, Oklahoma, which is up near Tulsa, there was … there’s actually quite a bit to do there. There’s I had, uh, I had quite a few friends. I was pretty, pretty shy back then. But it’s, uh, it’s kind of a big spread out town, and there was quite a bit to do around there. Um, I kind of just kept to myself though, actually. I, I read a lot. I re read a ton of comic books back then, and I … back then I was more into visual arts, and I would do a lot of drawing and sketching and some painting too, and every once in a great while I would drive arou-around with my friends. But but mostly, that’s kinda bored me, and then I realized they were gonna go try to get beer and liquor and stuff, and I really wasn’t into that junk, so I kind of just did my own thing. So, but I had I I have to say I’ve I’ve had a a good life growing up. I mean, all together — a really good life. I’ve had great parents they, they spoiled me pretty much when I was young. But I mean they definitely taught me the right and wrong about everything, too. And so, yeah its it growing up there was pretty fun. After, after that I moved around some and of course I live in western, southwesternish Oklahoma now. And, the town I came from, that I was in for the last four years, Elk City, that’s quite a small town and there’s quite a bit of a difference living there as opposed to Bartlesville. There’s not much to do, ah … I, I don’t think in Elk City. Again, I’m I’m still not really a person who has to re- rely on a lot of stuff out there to do. But, it’s it’s kind of a quiet little town.
