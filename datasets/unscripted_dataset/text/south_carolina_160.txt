Hmmm, it’s just something I’ve always felt destined to do, I feel like I been destined to do. Um, I was born under the sign of Leo and I like the limelight. I like just being in the limelight; I like being in the midst of a crowd, all attention on me, so I just love being out there; um, I just like it. I want to be an actress and always just if, if it’s something that you just wake up wanting to do and you try your hardest doing it whatever it is, then I think you should just go for it and that’s just something that I wanted to do. The book name came to me about sometime last year; I was, I like to read a lot of black authors, and I was just reading a book and I was like, OK, I all these stories are the same thing and if they can write all stories with ten books that’s the same, then I can write a book and get paid just as much as they do and be called the best novelist, so why not, and I tried, and I read it to a lot of my friends and they read it, and Miss Jocelyn also read the first chapter, and a lot of people like it so far, so I want to finish it and see what I get out of it.
