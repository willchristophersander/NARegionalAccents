Em, I grew up in Destrehan, a little town about 30 miles outside of New Orleans. It was very rural. We had a — one little country store. We picked blackberries in the summer and, uh swam, and did very country kind of things. And grew up with lots of family around always; and I was a tomboy, my cousin was a tomboy, so we had a great time growing up. I hated school. I liked recess and P.E. and playing sports after school. I hated lunch. And then I went into New Orleans for high school and college. And met my husband at a college in New Orleans. And I was 18 then. And uh … we wound up moving to New Orleans when we got married when I was 23, and had my first baby in New Orleans in Gentilly. And then we moved to Metairie in a move to the suburbs and had our second baby, and then we moved to the North Shore, uh, across Lake Ponchartrain, and we’ve been for about thirty years, and I’m 61 now. And I love to play tennis, and I have six grandchildren and they’re so much fun; and I’ve been married 38 years; and I love being married now; you, um, you appreciate it more when you get older. And, uh, I miss my parents dearly. I have a sister and a brother, um, who I treasure, especially with my parents gone. My dad and … my mom and dad were both from New Orleans; and um, his father was from LeHavre, France. And my dad didn’t speak English ‘til he went to school. He spoke…they spoke French at home. And they…they had a very close family too. We have a, um, above the ground, uh, cemetery monument whatever you call it, in the Metairie cemetery for the family. Most of the family’s buried in there. Very New Orleans traditionally [unclear] lived outside of New Orleans and very tied to it … uh, lots of family there.
