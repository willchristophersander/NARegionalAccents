Well, as you know, I was raised in Cuba — Pinar del Río — so I’m “Pinareña” [a term used for women from Pinar del Río]. Um, [tsk] I went to Ecuador, and I lived there for about a year and a half or so. Then I came to Miami, and I been here ever since. I went to high school here, nearby, and, um [tsk] I’d met Alex [husband] at Miami Dade [local community college]. We both went to FIU [Florida International University], and, um, we both graduated, [chuckles] got different careers. We’re still together [laughs] managing our, uh, different cultures, you know. Mm, I have my Cuban friends, and I also have my American friends, and I meet people from different countries. Yeah, so it’s a bunch of different cultures here, which is great.
