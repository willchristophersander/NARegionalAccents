Well, um, I grew up in central New Jersey. And I have an older brother who is, three years older than me and an older sister who is five years older than me. So by the time I made it to high school, my sister was off away at college and my brother and I had gotten, um, we formed a really close relationship. We were like best friends. And we would always – he was still living at home, and I – we would have these days that every once in a while when we were sick of school and we were sick of work, we would just like, we would play hookie. We would just skip it. We would skip school, skip work for the day. And, we called it our family cut day. And the two of us would go, and we would just go and do something fun for the day. We would go to the Liberty Science Center, or to a museum, or to, uh, Six Flags Great Adventure, which was in Jackson, New Jersey. And it was probably one of the most fun that I’ve had in my life because it was always, it was something we did together and we were able to have fun and we didn’t have to go to school or go to work anyways. So, it was just a really good way for us to get away and spend some time together and we really built our relationship, um, even more through having those days rather than just typical family Christmas and, over the dinner table and stuff. We were able to bond on a different level which nobody knew about, and still don’t know about to this day! Our parents don’t know, work doesn’t know, school doesn’t know. Um, so we just had a good time, and I really enjoyed it.
