Well, I grew up in New Orleans. Um, New Orleans is famous for food, women, wine and Mardi Gras. Um, during Mardi Gras, that’s the season that everything really starts to going, and that’s where everybody in New Orleans comes out. Um, my favorite story is, uh, one … the first year I was … rode in the parades on Mardi Gras Day. Um, it starts off you get up at 4 o’clock in the morning. You have to get in costume. You have to get on the float. And, uh, the parade doesn’t start until 9 o’clock in the morning, but you’ve been up since 4 o’clock, at the parade site, gettin’ in all these costumes. And this one Mardi Gras, the first year, uh, my parents had spent, oh, about four-hundred dollars on beads and stuff for me to throw. And before the parade even started, I had given away about half of my beads, to, to people just walkin’ up and down the site. I wasn’, maybe, 14 years old at the time. And, my parents just got angry, because I, I didn’t have much left to throw. By the halfway through the parade, I was diggin’ in their bags and other peoples’ bags. But I … it was really fun. We had, uh, that was my first experience in, um … that was a parade called Zulu, which is a all African-American parade. It’s the only African parade in Mardi Gras, so, that was, um, my first adventures in Mardi Gras. It was wild. They had people lined up, showing, uh, body parts to me for beads and stuff. I … my parents were upset, but I enjoyed it, and that’s how I grew up.
