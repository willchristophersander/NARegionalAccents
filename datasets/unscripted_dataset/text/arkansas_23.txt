I was born July the 10th, 1936, in Van Alstyne, Texas. And then, uh, when I was about 14 months old, my parents decided to move to Arkansas. So we moved to Washington County, Arkansas, and I grew up in Washington County. Um, I really had quite a wonderful childhood, even though we were poor. I was the youngest of ten: five girls and five boys. And, uh, I had wonderful parents. They absolutely adored each other, and just, uh, demonstrated it, and, uh, I just — I just feel like I had a wonderful childhood. And, uh, like I say, we didn’t have much money, but we had a farm and had plenty to eat. And, um, my mother made most of our clothes. I remember one time it was Easter and she made me a beautiful yellow dress out of a- out of two feed sacks. If you don’t know what a feed sack is, we raised chickens, for the market. And, uh, the feed sacks, uh: When the feed would come, they’d come in hundred pounds, and, uh, it was just like cloth you buy in the store. So my mother made me a beautiful yellow dress, with lace on it, and little tiny black ribbon to feed into that lace and then tie the little bows.
