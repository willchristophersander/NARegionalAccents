I’m18 years old. I was born and raised in Oklahoma City. Um, um, my family, however, is from Maine. We were there for about six generations. We got there before the Revolutionary War, and we stayed there since, but for some reason my parents decided to come down to Oklahoma to have babies. Um, I do love Oklahoma; it”s a nice place to grow up, and we have a growing population of really fantastic things, like we just got a NBA team, and sports are really huge here. I’m personally not a huge fan. I think they are kind of boring. but it brings in some really great revenue. We also have a huge growing arts community, and our film community is blazing fast. We have had a lot of movies come through here in the past five years. Um, and, um, I’m trying to get in to some of them. I don’t know. Ha, ha, maybe that will work. I’m actually a classically trained Shakespearian actress. I’ve been trained at the American Shakespeare Center and several places like that, and I just choose to let my accent have the better of my words because I kind of feel like it gives me a little bit of character and it’s natural. Um, you know sometimes perfect American English doesn’t really sound natural, um, and I kinda like the way it sounds. As for Oklahoma, we have, you know, stereotypical idioms like “y’all” and things like that, but it’s really not too bad.
