I was born in South Carolina in 1951. Um, I moved to California in 1978. Um, I still seem to retain my Southern accent. A lot of people ask me even now where Iâ€™m from. I believe that I still have this accent because I speak often to my family on the phone, and I, um, visit them on a regular basis, and so every time I speak to them I sort of pick it up again.
