I was born in, uh, St. Michael, Azores, and, um, I lived there for about a year. It’s in Portugal. Azores is — Portugal has seven — is it seven or nine little islands, that actually is away from Portugal, but it belongs to Portugal. So I was born, like I said, St. Michael, Azores. And then, um, a year after, we just came to America, and I was — America. Actually we came to East Cambridge, Massachusetts. And then, basically I was just raised in East Cambridge, and [laughs] guess I’ve still been here. When we moved here, there was very little Portuguese people here. It was just — I don’t- – I wouldn’t even know, maybe like 5 percent. Now I’d say there’s — it’s gotta be like about 70 percent Portuguese, if not more. Even like if you notice down Cambridge Street: all the little Portuguese shops, little Portuguese clubs that the guys hang out at. [Laughs] It’s just so funny. I know I turn to my Internet because there’s certain — even though if you try to block certain programs, you can still — well, TV, I think we were talking about MTV, and how it’s — there’re programs on there that are not suitable for children. And what they show, you know, certain things like that, I strongly believe they shouldn’t show at all, but that’s my opinion. And, um, you know when we were talking about … Google? Wasn’t it Google? How that even though if you have the parental block on it, if you type in a certain word, it will still pop up a certain image that you don’t want to see? Yeah, and, uh, I basically just sit at the reception desk, answer the phone. If someone comes in, and they have a general question, if I can answer it, I do. Shippin’/receiving, I’m also in charge of that. There’s just so much that — half of the stuff — I, I automatically do, but I don’t remember what I was describin’. There is so much to do, and it’s so hard to … If I were to list it down, it would take me a whole full day to really list every little detail.
