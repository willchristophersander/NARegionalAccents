Well, I was born in 1958 in Washington. At 3 years old, I moved to the Bay Area, worked in refineries. At, ss, 18, I moved to Clearlake and worked in the oil fields. At 50 years old, I moved back to the Bay area, where I once lived and started. Talk about a complete circle. I now work in refineries again, and life is good, period.
