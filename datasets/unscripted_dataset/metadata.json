    "unscripted_text": "I was born and raised in a small town just outside of Birmingham, called Adamsville. Um, there was about 250 people in the entire town. Little, little tiny place, everybody knew everything about everybody, which is \u2026 probably effects a lot of how I am today. [Laughs] Kind of keeping everything quiet so that the neighbors won\u2019t find out. But, um, and now I\u2019m a senior theater major at Birmingham Southern, um, with no clue about what I\u2019m gonna do when I get out of here. But, uh, I live with my parents and my grandmother. We, we all live together, and, uh, it\u2019s been that way for about ten years now. And, um, it, it\u2019s kind of weird, \u2019cause you see people out with their families. It\u2019s usually the parents and the kids, sit- sitting at the table in the restaurant or whatever, and then you\u2019d look over and see my family. And it\u2019s my parents, and then me sitting next to my grandmother, with her big white hair. And, um, she always orders the same thing at restaurants: a salad and a baked potato. She grew up in Mississippi, so she didn\u2013 she doesn\u2019t eat a lot of meat. And she only eats things that have been pulled directly from the ground, unless she\u2019s cooked it herself. Then she\u2019ll open up the can and fix it right. But, um, yeah, that\u2013 that\u2019s one good thing about growing up with a grandmother in the house: The cooking is always wonderful. Um, my mom, unfortunately, has fallen out of practice with cooking, and she\u2019s like, \u201cOh, well, I guess I\u2019ll just get mother to do it. \u2019Cause I can\u2019t do anything any more.\u201d But, um, yeah, I guess that\u2019s where I get most of my accent, which is a lot thicker when I talk about them. And when I talk to them, it\u2019s even thicker. But, I, I guess, being in the theater I\u2019ve tried my best to be able to hide it as much as possible, but it still sneaks in there occasionally. My favorite food? Oh goodness, there are so many. I guess it would have to be my grandmother\u2019s cornbread. She makes the best cornbread in the world. In a skillet, in the oven, so it\u2019s all crispy, all over. Not these little muffins that you get in a restaurant, uhn-uh. Gotta be this big loaf of cornbread that you cut in little wedges, and it\u2019s so soft in the middle and just so crispy and almost burnt on the outside; it\u2019s just incredible. Best thing in the world."

    "unscripted_text": "I\u2019ve lived in Birmingham all of my life. Um, my mother was originally from Michigan, but she spent most of her life down here in Alabama, and my father has always lived here. I went to Hewitt-Trussville, which is a really po-dunk kind of school, but it was a lot of fun. It taught me a lot of characterization. It was just very useful in theater. I\u2019m a sophomore musical theater major, here at Birmingham Southern, and I plan, when I get out of school to maybe venture a little bit, maybe into Nashville, maybe Georgia, but not New York yet. It\u2019s a little scary. It\u2019s a little too big and busy for me. The characters from my school, uh, would wear cowboy boots to school, and the big cowboy hats, and they\u2019d talk \u2019bout huntin\u2019 all the time, and what they did, and how many deers they caught over the weekend. And, you know, what they shot it with, and you know, \u201cDo you like deers?\u201d And I\u2019d have to say [laughs], \u201cI like them, but I don\u2019t really like to shoot them.\u201d And, um, my grandmother, my great-grandmother, actually, was my favorite part about growing up as a child because she would always cook this incredible Thanksgiving meal. Just like Chris, she had the cornbread, and she used to fuss at me about not eating enough. Every single Thanksgiving she\u2019d be like, \u201cDon\u2019t you want some more stuffin\u2019? Girl, you\u2019re getting\u2019 skinnier every year. You\u2019re just like a little bird.\u201d And she would fuss at me so much. But, it was one of my favorite memories. Oh, she used to love to make black-eyed peas, and green beans, turkey, and ham, and oh, coconut cake, coconut cream cake, every Thanksgiving. It was the best. I have two brothers. One\u2019s older and one\u2019s younger, and the little one\u2019s name is Bobby. And he hasn\u2019t developed a real strong Southern accent yet, and I\u2019m hoping he never will. But the first year I came home from college and I\u2019d had all the vocal training, he looked at me, and I sa- I had said something to him. And he looked at me, he was like, \u201cYou done lost your accent.\u201d I was like, \u201cBobby, I wasn\u2019t aware that I ever had an accent.\u201d And he goes, \u201cOh, yeah, you did.\u201d So, he laughed at me a lot, and he sa- He calls me hoity-toity now because I don\u2019t talk with a Southern accent. I didn\u2019t have to work as hard as other people do, I still, I hear it in my voice sometimes, and I try really hard not to let it come through. But I kind of appreciate it. I think it adds more voice to my, more character to my voice, and I kinda cherish it."

    "unscripted_text": "I was born in northeastern Alabama. I was born in Jackson County, and that\u2019s, um, in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains. Uh, the Jackson County borders on Georgia and Tennessee. My, uh, ancestors have probably lived there for well over a hundred years. I was, uh, raised on a farm. My father had a cotton farm, and a corn farm. And so as I grew up, I picked cotton, hoed cotton, pulled corn, fed animals and worked in a chicken house. And having done all that, I don\u2019t there\u2019s anything that is, uh, beneath my doing. If you\u2019ve slopped hogs, you can do lots of things. I attended a small school. I think there were 15 folks in my ninth-grade class. Uh, my parents were unable to finish school themselves, because of their economic circumstances. My father was an orphan by the time he was 14, and my mother grew up in a very poor family, so they were not able to finish high school. Uh, the teachers that I had were very quickly, uh, my role models, and I would look toward them for what I was hoping my future would be, which would not be out somewhere in the hot sunshine, picking cotton. There\u2019s not a lot of free time on a farm, but as I remember back on the things that we did in our leisure time, I remember simple things like playin\u2019 hopscotch, playin\u2019 with dolls, playin\u2019 in a playhouse outdoors, watchin\u2019 TV, playin\u2019 dress-up, uh, listenin\u2019 to the radio. And our homes were close together, although we lived in a farming community, so many times we would meet our neighbor friends outside, and we would ride our bikes. We would, uh, play softball. Sometimes we would have war with corncobs, which could be quite dangerous at times. I remember riding my bicycle, uh, with a neighbor. She was riding the bicycle; I was on the handlebars, and somebody was on the back seat. And we had this giant hill that we would tra- travel down. And one day as we were driving down the hill, we were, seemed to be going at the speed of light, and I was ejected from the bicycle, went rolling down the hill, and I have two scars now to prove that I was in that accident. Uh, so most of our free time we spent just doin\u2019 the simple outdoorsy sorts of things, not a lot of TV watching, just very limited TV were we allowed. I also remember when we first got our telephone, which, I suppose people of my generation had telephones when they were born, but I didn\u2019t. And I remember I was probably about 9 or 10 years old when we first got our phone. And we had a party line, so if you were to use the phone, you would pick up the phone and you would hear other conversations. Was really, uh, you really would want to listen to those conversations, but you knew it was wrong, so you would quickly pick it up and then hang up the phone. And I remember being limited to \u2014 my time on the phone \u2014 to 15 minute. I couldn\u2019t talk any longer than 15 minutes on the telephone, which is probably a lot different from our young folks today. As I think about, uh, growing up, and I think about some of my fond memories, a lot of those would revolve around holidays. One in particular is Halloween, and I think Halloween is still one of my favorite times, simply because of the experience that I had at Miss Davis\u2019s home. Uh, Miss Davis was an elderly lady, and she seemed to be elderly all my life. And she had had a large family, so she had a dining room table that sat either 12 or 14 people. I can\u2019t recall exactly which. But at Halloween she would have her table just heavy with all her home-baked goodies, she would have, uh, popcorn balls, candied apples, cookies, cupcakes. Christmas was, um, a fun time, just like it is for all kids. My sister and I spent a good bit of time playing the guessing game as to where our mom might have hidden our gifts. And particularly I remember the Christmas that we were to receive stuffed animals. Stuffed animals were really the rage. All the young girls wanted a huge stuffed animal, and so did we. So we prowled through the house till we found our stuffed animals. Uh, I received a pink poodle, and my sister had a purple poodle. And we\u2019d play with those for hours when our parents weren\u2019t inside the home, and tried to put on a really surprised face the day we looked under the Christmas tree. Although we had been enjoying them for weeks."

    "unscripted_text": "I was born in Tuskegee, Alabama, June 22nd, 1942, a thousand years ago. And this was in, ah, Macon County, Alabama. Tuskegee is a very special town, I think. Ah, is 98 percent African-American. Most of the African-American people there were people who were educated, who had professional careers. They were doctors, lawyers, teachers, nurses. One reason is that, ah, Tuskegee University was there (started in 1881), and, and that the life of the black people in the town really centered around Tuskegee. The other thing is that we never had any industry of note there, so that, ah, unless you were maybe a farmer, there was nothing to do if you didn\u2019t go to school, you know, go to college. And I\u2019m talking about the period that I grew up in, you know, you know\u2026\u2019cause I was in high school in the fifties and I went to college in the sixties, right? My family, my father came to the area in the thirties, when he was thirteen years old. And he was a country boy. Came from Grove Hill, Alabama, and he came to Tuskegee to study at the institute at the time, you know. My mother came there in, um I think, \u201939 as a nurse. And my father eventually worked at the veteran\u2019s hospital there. My mother was working at the veteran\u2019s hospital \u2014 that\u2019s how they met. I also went to Catholic school. All the school were good, I think; but the Catholic school really was strong on teaching English and grammar. And Sister Clemenza was ferocious. And when I graduated from high school I went to Butler University in Indianapolis because I wanted to become a dancer. And, of course, ah, and my parents said I had to go to college they didn\u2019t care what I decided I wanted to do, as long as I went to college. There was no opportunity to do that in, um, Tuskegee. And you have to remember that this was in the \u201960s, everything was segregated and if there were opportunities anywhere around, I couldn\u2019t take advantage of them. I couldn\u2019t even come to Auburn \u2019cause it was, you know, I was black. Couldn\u2019t come here. Ah, there were about four dance schools in the, in the country and I went to Butler University at the time. Now that\u2019s in Indianapolis but I do know that I was a dance major surrounded by a whole cadre of very artistic and highly articulate people. But when I left, um, Butler, I went to New York. I\u2019d already been to New York. I would go to New York in the summer to study dance. Here was a little southern girl going to New York, you know, when I was like 15, 16. I also went to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania some of those summers. Now, you know, Pittsburgh\u2019s kinda very distinct. But I, thank goodness, did not pick up any of their dialect. [Laughs] I never really liked that so much. And when I graduated from college I went to, um, New York City and I was there just about a year. Had my first professional experience. Got sick and had to go home again. Got a job teaching dance while I was recovering. That was teaching dance in college in Howard University in Washington, D.C. So I was there for five years. And I traveled a lot. Ah, I left Howard to go to Boston. To work, um, I worked at an arts center there. And then I got the opportunity to go to Europe to Brussels, Belgium, ah, to dance with the ballet, Ballet of the Twentieth Century in Brussels. Now that was, ah, my first trip to Europe. And then I got the opportunity to work on Broadway, ah, with, you know, Billy Wilson in, in, um Bubbling Brown Sugar. And we live in, you know, for like six weeks at a time in Chicago, in Toronto, in Philadelphia, in Washington, D.C., and then came back to Broadway. Then afterwards\u2026after the\u2026I, I decided I wanted to come home again to Tuskegee because I wanted to start a theatre company. And I wanted to make sure that other little African-American girls, like myself, would not necessarily have to go away to, at least, begin a professional career in theatre or in dance. And I was thinking about a dance company, so I came home and I began to work with the, um, ah, the city of Tuskeegee; they hired me to be Director of Cultural Affairs. So I had a whole thing I was teaching dance, plus I was dealing with the whole cultural affair thing\u2026affairs thing, you know. Um, anything that culturally related to\u2026I mean, things like celebrating Martin Luther King\u2019s birthday, um, um, other cultural highlights in the community, celebrating the history of the community, plus to understand [word unclear]. I can wrap it up now. What were the greatest influence on my speech? Hmm. I don\u2019t know. I think my teachers in grade school. My parents who insisted that I speak, try to speak, correct English. You see, as a black person, I can switch off. I can speak, I can say, \u201cI ain\u2019t gonna do that.\u201d I don\u2019t know how to tell you, but sometimes when black people are together we can speak in another tone. Not necessarily bad English but say another thing which involves a whole lot of colloquial things that you just don\u2019t say. And then I can switch off and talk another way, you know. I\u2019m like a chameleon. Ah, what else? Dialects? Hmmm. I think that\u2019s enough about me."

I\u2019ve always lived in this area, \u2018cept for the time that I \u2018tended college in Montevallo, Alabama \u2018n\u2019, uh, as far as I know, all of my family lived in this area before me, fo\u2019 as far back as anybody can remember, \u2018n\u2019, for many years, the cotton-mill industry was, actually, the life\u2019s blood of the valley area. The mill cottonry provided jobs for most of the people there, money for schools and also a lot of recreational centers, plus a lot more. As the economy changed, however, some of the mills down-sized or closed \u2018n\u2019 as a result, many \u201cvalley-ans\u201d today must commute to jobs outside the valley area. I grew up in a family with both parents, an older sister and a younger brother. My family was musically inclined and we all played musical instruments. Ev\u2019ryone in my family also enjoyed reading and this is still one of my greatest pleasures. I find it to be a wonderful escape. Also, one of the favorite Southern pasttimes, at least in my family, was tellin\u2019 stories. You jus\u2019 pass them down from generation to generation; they\u2019re not written anywhere, \u2018n\u2019 each time you tell them, they become more fanciful or more involved. I \u2018tended and was graduated from the Lanett City School System, and I subsequently attended several schools: the University of Montevallo, Auburn University, Southern Union State Community College, and Troy State University in Phenix City, Alabama, before finally earning my B.S. degree. By that time, I had a child, and it was a little bit harder to attend school, so it took me quite a while to do this. All of these schools, except the University of Montevallo, were within fifty miles of my home. I believe, that probably, the greatest influences on my speech had to be my family and my earliest friends, since I\u2019ve never really lived anywhere but in \u201cthe valley\u201d area. And, also, I received very little influence from television as a small child, because our family di[d] not even own a TV until I was 5 or 6 years old."

    "unscripted_text": "I\u2019m from Coosa County, but I was originally born in Birmingham, Alabama. I don\u2019t remember which hospital. I think it was Cooper Green, but I spent, like, fifteen years in Coosa County and, like, about five to six years in Birmingham. My parents are from Birmingham, originally. My momma, she was born in Detroit, but my daddy, he\u2019s born and raised from Birmingham. My father and my mother about 26, two or three years older than me, and they stayed in Montgomery for about, about three years. And then they moved back to Birmingham when they had me. And, my parents, both of them graduated high school. My father, he was a, he played football in high school. And my mother, she was in the band. I think she was, like uh, a drum major or something. But, my father, he had a chance to play college football, but he didn\u2019t really have anybody that liked to talk to him and teach him right from wrong because his mother passed when he was about, when he was about ten. So, he ended up just, just taking construction work, and my mother, she, she graduated high school and she also was uh, and she also, her mother also passed when she was real young. I don\u2019t know what age she was but, but her mother passed and her father he married another woman and that woman, she raised my mother and her other siblings. And, I played sports in high school, I went to uh, Coosa County Central, Central Coosa, it\u2019s near Alex City. And I played football and basketball for four years. And, I won a championship when I was in 10th grade, and I won another state championship when I was in the 11th grade. And my 12th grade year I hurt my knee when I went to a basketball camp so I wasn\u2019t able to perform the way I wanted to perform so that I could get colleges to look at me in regards to playing college basketball. So, I ended up going to Alabama State University my first year of college, and I really didn\u2019t like it so, so I transferred to Auburn and I tried out for the basketball team and I didn\u2019t make it my first tryout, but I tried out the following year and I made the team. I only played like a half a year, because my girlfriend at the time, she had got pregnant with my son, so I quit and I started back working. I worked at Walmart before I started playing so I just went back there. I worked in produce, and me and my wife, we had a son and I decided I wanted to join the military. So I did, I joined the Air Force National Guard, because I needed the extra money and I needed the benefits so I could support my family, my new family. And I really wanted to play basketball because all my life I loved basketball. I watched every basketball game came on, on the weekend weekday I watched it. And my father, he bought me and my brother a basketball goal and set it out in the yard, but he was kind of mean to us, so when he was setting it up he wanted us to help but, we were about, 8 to 12 at the time, and we really didn\u2019t, we really didn\u2019t care about nothing but playing, so we weren\u2019t serious, so he used to holler at us a lot. I believe he was kind of stressed because he worked two jobs and my mother, she really didn\u2019t work. So, I believe he was kind of stressed because he worked, like, the overnight shift and then he had to get up in the morning, well he had to get off work in the morning and go work at uh, at a trailer park. He fixed on trailers, so we didn\u2019t really get to spend too much time with my father because he was mainly sleep during the day, and we got home from school he was, he was gone to work or either sleep. But, now that I\u2019ve grown up and had a chance to talk to my father, like I understood his struggle and I understood what he was going through, just uh, just to take care of his family, and I respect that. And also, I want to try and do that for my son but also I want to be there for him and try to give him the things that I didn\u2019t have growing up as a child."

They don\u2019t open any of the nearby creeks, where we can access like, long time ago we were able to get our fish from a fish- fish creek in Douglas. And all of us kids used to just go in and get our fishing quota and then take it home an\u2019 dry it. But now that\u2019s closed to us and so you pretty much have to have a boat, just to get your food. And then if you don\u2019t have a boat, you just barter with people who make it like. My husband and I, um, get our fish from, um, people who live in Klukwan. So we, we trade. I do a lot of beadwork, so I trade beadwork. Sockeye\u2019s the best, uh, fish that you can get, and we usually get it full dried, semi-dried, and, uh, cold pack, which is like your tuna fish in the cans. And then you\u2019ve got like the smoked strips, which is the best kind you can get, the smoked strips. So, my, my mouth is startin\u2019 to water. [Laughs] It\u2019s, yeah, we didn\u2019t have that luxury of just bein\u2019 at home. But then we had more fun, I think. Saw lots of people, because we went to all these different camp areas, and then we went out to different towns. Like we used to end up in Pelican for Fourth of July, and, um, we went to Hoonah a lot, which is where my father comes from. And then in the summertime, we stayed in, uh, Icy Straits, and they had the cannery open then. So, up until I was 13, 14 years old, that\u2019s where I grew up at, in the summertime. And a lot of berry-picking, for winter. We used to go into Dundas Bay, in the fall time, after the canneries and things closed. And we used to pick what were called nagoon. They\u2019re little berries that kind of grow off the ground, like strawberries, and, uh, they kinda look like salmonberries, but they\u2019re red, really good, and well, a taste all its own.

Um, I was very scared because I didn\u2019t know any English, but actually it wasn\u2019t that bad because all my professors were Hispanic. The kids were Hispanic too, and, um, so I didn\u2019t have to speak English but until fourth grade, because in fourth grade it was the first time I ever got an American professor and her name was Mrs. Taylor, and that\u2019s when I had to start speaking in English. I remember I used to sit all the way in the back of class because I was so embarrassed because I didn\u2019t want her to pick on me to read. Um, I never forgot a moment when she was teaching us English and she wrote on the board, \u201cchocolate.\u201d And I was so confused because I was like it says \u201cchocolate,\u201d and it\u2019s spelled the same way as in English and I couldn\u2019t \u2014 and it was bugging me that it was just pronounced different. Um, and then after Mrs. Taylor once again I started having Hispanic professors. All throughout middle school as well, actually \u2014 Yuma, Arizona, has a large population of Hispanic, and when I went to high school, in Cibola High School, again, um, I had more American professors, and that\u2019s when I officially began to speak English in my freshmen year of high school. Um, so it\u2019s been pretty interesting. I don\u2019t hear my accent, but everybody else does. Um, and now here at ASU, once I oh I started\u2026began theatre, uh, that\u2019s when it just really like \u2014 I noticed how much of an impact my accent can actually have because, uh, just in auditions and doing monologues. I\u2018ve heard both; I\u2019ve heard pros and cons of me having an accent, uh, for different roles. There\u2019s roles that I cannot do because of my accent. Well, I can do, but I just need to work on it. I\u2019m in a play right now for Bocon. Uh, I\u2019m not sure if maybe my accent is what influenced my director to choose me. Huh, um, but I\u2019m pretty \u2014 I really excited to be in Bocon because it\u2019s bilingual and my family is going to come watch it and my family don\u2019t speak any English. So, they\u2019re pretty excited because they\u2019ll be able to understand some of it. I dream in Spanish. I, uh, It\u2019s funny because I just actually just had a dream yesterday. It was in Spanish. All my dreams that I have I don\u2019t remember any of them ever being in English. That\u2019s an interesting question."

Uh, so, I guess it\u2019s kind of a miracle that I survived.

And, uh, so, anyway, she got me off the well, and, uh, I didn\u2019t, I didn\u2019t go down in it, but, uh, a lot of memories like that. I can remember, um, \u2019specially bein\u2019 about 5 years old when the first set of kids came along after me, uh, all of the diapers, that we had. And we had, every window had a clothesline that left the house and went to, you know, a fence post or a pole or whatever. And, uh, diapers in the hallway, and diapers in the commode, diapers everywhere, so, uh, you couldn\u2019t go to the bathroom without having to clean diapers, \u2019cause there was three in diapers all at the same time. Uh, went to a lot of different schools till I reached the ninth grade. There were two different years that I attended four different grade schools in the same year. Went, uh, to schools primarily in the, uh, San Francisco/Oakland/Bay area in California, and then, uh, if I wasn\u2019t in school there, we\u2019d move back to St. Louis and go to school in different schools in St. Louis, uh, around St. Louis and [unclear]. Uh, after, or startin\u2019 in, the ninth grade, we moved to Greenwood, Arkansas, and, uh, my dad was a farmer and a carpenter. Basically, uh, I spent four years \u2013 that\u2019s the longest that I spent at any one school, except for the University of Arkansas \u2013 four years in high school. Graduated, oh, I don\u2019t know, top 10 percent, but not all that good. Came to the University in \u201966, and graduated here in \u201970, and then waited about ten, or, no, I guess it\u2019s about 18 years I waited, came back and worked on my master\u2019s. And got my master\u2019s here at the University of Vocational Education. Currently, uh, I\u2019m married. My wife\u2019s name is Janice. We have a daughter whose name is Shannon. She\u2019s about 27. She\u2019s married, has a husband. Uh, his name\u2019s Brett, uh, Brett Lawson. And no grandkids yet, but look forward to it soon. Uh, none yet. Uh, I basically now am employed at the University of Arkansas. Uh, I do little remodeling projects for homeowners around in the area, a little bit.

And I\u2019d go to bed with my sister; we both slept in the same room. And before that I\u2019d pulled a wagon up to my window. And our, my mother put us to bed. I opened the window and crawled out into the wagon and went playin\u2019. I was playin\u2019 for two or three hours before my mother finally figured out that I was outside. And she ran out to git me, I ran and hid in the cotton field. And my hair was bleach-blond, and they couldn\u2019t find me. I stood out there, an\u2019 I could see them but they couldn\u2019t see me. But then my mother told me there was a big snake out in the cotton field so I came runnin\u2019 out of the cotton field and she caught me. I remember another incident. I\u2019d always climb trees when I was a little kid, just like 3, 4, 5 years old. And I climbed an oak tree, I believe it was, way up to the top. My mother was seven-months pregnant with my brother, and, uh, she said that was the last time she was comin\u2019 to git me. Cause, like, the day before that she climbed up the tree to git me and she fell out, and hurt herself. And it was probably three o\u2019clock in the afternoon, when she found me up in the tree, and my dad didn\u2019t get off till about 7. So she told me I had to stay in the tree the whole time. And I started to fall asleep, and she couldn\u2019t climb up the tree; she had to stay out there with me. And she used a fishin\u2019 pole, she\u2019d hit the branches with it and try an\u2019 keep me awake. And, uh, when my dad got home \u2013 whew! I\u2019ll never forget that day."

We, uh, lived in a town called Dyer, which is outside of Alma. It\u2019s off in the country. And, um, it was much smaller, but we still went to Alma schools, because it, you know, it\u2019s not a very large town. Um, I remember when I was younger, we had two horses and one of \u2014 one of them was named Sunny. I cannot remember what the other one was named. Well, we kept horses \u2014 those two horses, you know, for a few years, when I was young. And I guess we got rid of the two horses, probably some- somewhere around the time my sister was born. We lived \u2014 we lived a fairly \u2014 fairly good ways outside of Alma, proba- probably about ten minutes. Um, my dad, my father, his name\u2019s Wes. He was born and raised in the town called Danville, which is a very sma- Danville, Arkansas, very, very small community. And my mother was raised in a town ten minutes outside of Danville, called Havana. Which was even smaller. I think the most they had at Havana, from what my grandmother tells me, was about a train station and a little grocery store. But, they grew up, I guess, about ten miles away from each other. I believe they got married in probably around 1965. Well, no, probably \u201968 or \u201969. That\u2019s probably about it. Um, so they\u2019re, they were from, not from the city, I\u2019ll say that much. Um, my mother was an only child. My grandmother, she immigrated to this country from Ireland, when she was probably about 15, around that age somewhere. And her father, my grandfather, was a Major League baseball pitcher. And, back in the \u201830s, and he pitched for, uh, the St. Louis Browns, and the Detroit Tigers and the Toronto Bluejays. And also for a minor-league team in Texas."

My parents both retired, just this past December; after serving as, uh, the county clerk and the deputy clerk for, uh, 24 years. And my father also owns a farm, where he raises beef cattle. So, trips to the farm were a fun thing, when I was younger. That\u2019s where we went and got our Christmas trees. And, um, I would pick them out, and my dad would cut them down. And, we would bring them home and my mother would complain that they were too big. Because they always look a lot taller in the field than they do when you get them in the house. And so they would double over on the ceiling and we would have to cut the top out or something. And so, she gave us the rule that we could never get any trees taller than my father was. But \u2026 so that\u2019s one of my memories, from growing up, and the farm. And getting to feed baby cattle, from out of the bottle, things like that."

And, um [noise] grew up out south of the town in \u2014 on the ranch \u2014 on the ranch. So I grew up, you know, doing all the animals and the 4H projects and, um, riding horses and helping in the hay fields in the summer. And, um, I showed pigs and lambs and, uh, and my horse, too. I loved that. I always showed horses and, um, in the rodeo did barrels and the different things like that. So that was a lot of fun. Uh, growing up that was pretty much my favorite thing to do, was the time of year that I liked was the fair time and being in, in the fair grounds and, um, and rodeo and all that. That was really the, the best time of the year and what I looked forward to all year. And then, of course, we\u2019d, you know, sell our animals and make a little money. And then we\u2019d go to Pueblo and, um, and shop and, and go to the state fair at Pueblo. And that was a big treat every year to do that. And I still, still love to do that and take my kids there. So that\u2019s fun. Um, went to high school here and graduated here and then went to Denver. Um, and \u2014 uh, let\u2019s see, well I actually went to school in Greeley and, and in Boulder and then in Denver. So I went to Metro State in Denver. And, um, I really loved my time in Denver, too. I was up there almost, well, over 15 years. And, um, my husband was a Denver police officer. And, you know, we just loved it there, kind of put the, the farm side of it aside for a few years. And then when our kids got to be old enough that, you know, I felt like I\u2019d really like for them to have the same kind of experience that I had growing up here. And so we moved back about seven years ago. And now my kids are doing 4H and, and doing all of that and enjoying the mountains. And \u2014 like to \u2014 really don\u2019t get to camp as much as we\u2019d like to. But, um, you know, look at the mountains, anyway. It seems like people that don\u2019t live here actually are up in the mountains enjoying them more than the people that are here. But plan on trying to get up there a little bit more this summer."

And nobody really goes to the swimming pool. But, uh, then we all longboard down Main Street at night. Everybody cruises Main Street in their trucks \u2014 all the younger kids, or course. And my mom actually said that she did that when she was younger, that everybody would just pile into a vehicle and just cruise up and down, and everybody sits in the school parking lot and talks. And we always go to the lake and, uh, we always just hang out at people\u2019s houses. It\u2019s not \u2014 it\u2019s definitely a lot different than, you know, a big city where you can just go to Walmart or the mall or, whenever you want and hang out.

I, uh, my, uh, my dad was, uh, grew up in Brooklyn, New York; my mom, uh, grew up in Rochester, in upstate New York. Um, so Norwalk is pretty close to New York City; it\u2019s maybe an hour\u2019s train ride or so, um, but I, we always felt that we spoke differently from people in New York. And, I had some cousins, for example who, uh, lived in New Jersey, and they, whenever they came to visit they definitely spoke with a big accent. Um, and my dad, uh, the kids, I was the youngest of six kids, and we used to kind of tease my dad sometimes, because he would speak in ways that we, to me, to us was very, uh, was like a Brooklyn accent, or there was, it was different than the way we spoke. So, for example, he would say orange instead of orange; we would all say orange. Um, and he would, he would say, um, for like Mary, the girl\u2019s name, or marry like marrying someone, or, or eat, drink and be merry, we would pronounce those all the same; it\u2019s all marry to us, but he would pronounce them differently, something like marry, or merry. Um, so we would sometimes talk about that. Uh, so local names, so Norwalk, um, some of the r-, uh, towns around it are Wilton, New Canaan, Darien, Westport; um, if you go towards New York, along the coast there, there\u2019s also Stamford and Greenwich, um, and then the opposite way, um, after Westport, it\u2019s Fairfield, Bridgeport, New Haven, um, and up north is Danbury, after Wilton and New Canaan."

Savannah has always been a city that did not, as long as we knew what one another was doing and who they were doing; didn\u2019t really matter, but as soon as the rest of the world started looking in on us it made a big difference, you know, and there are a lot of, umm, so to speak bluebloods here in this city that, umm, are very private, and they think that the book [Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil] shone, umm, an unflattering light on us because they, they felt like you know it just it showed a bunch of freaks and fairies, so to speak, and I just, I didn\u2019t really look at it like that.

And the big thing I can remember living here when I was in my early twenties, and the big thing on Sunday afternoons was you started out with a bottle of cheap wine and you garden-party hopped. You just went from garden party to garden party, and it didn\u2019t matter whether it was somebody like me that was having one or somebody like, umm, Alvin Kneely [spelling?] or the, umm, the Levis [spelling?] or someone like that. You walk by their garden gate was open you got invited in, and that era\u2019s gone and I hate to see that. I think the book changed a lot of that.

You can\u2019t invite them into your house and stuff for obvious reasons, but there\u2019s, umm, I think it\u2019s been a good influence on Savannah, but also anytime you progress you lose something, right, so, I dunno.

I was from a small town in Georgia, but went to a, a boarding school in Atlanta, where the chaplain was an Episcopal clergyman. So he was really on me to go there to college, and, so, despite my parents\u2019 wish that I go to Emery for undergraduate work, I decided to go to Sewanee instead; just to sort of defy them, as people are wont to do at that age. It was a great choice; it was a wonderful school, and I did end up getting to go to Emery, and came here afterwards and have been here ever since. Lo, these, uh, many decades, and while it was very different from Sewanee and Emery, uh, I\u2019ve been very happy here and have really enjoyed being here, because I think Auburn is very special place, even, I\u2019d dare say, unique, in terms of the atmosphere and of the relations between the students and the professors. And of course, I can\u2019t complain, it\u2019s not that far from my home. And over the years it\u2019s made it possible for me to be near family both in Georgia and in Alabama, which I think is very, very nice, when one\u2019s close to one\u2019s family, as am I. So I\u2019m always glad to have that opportunity, and who knows? I could have gotten a job far away and not had these opportunities at being so close to family. And, believe it or not, Auburn over the decades has grown, not so much in numbers of students \u2014 there were about 16,000 when I came, and 22[000] or so now \u2014 but in terms of what we can do and places we can go. And, always, especially my first year here, I kept telling myself [unclear] Atlanta is less than two hours away, meaning there was a world outside. And this is very important when you are a single professor and you need a little social life. Because, uh, it probably is not wise to, um, play with undergraduates, and so it was good to get away to Atlanta, and, uh, get to be with friends over there, when I had, uh, a desire at that time in life to have a wild old time and, uh, go, so I could just go to Atlanta and get all of that out of my system and then come here, and, um, go to McDonald\u2019s or something more tame."

I live right in back o\u2019 the vol\u2013 the airport. And so, like around nine o\u2019clock, when there\u2019s no airplanes coming in, I go to the airport and watch, across the horizon. There\u2019s like a little red bump \u2014 it looks like a pimple, on the night skyline. It\u2019s pretty exciting. It\u2019s pretty cool. I like it. You know Hot Water Pond? Out by the volcano, \u2019cause of the volcano there\u2019s underwater vents, an- and there \u2014 there\u2019s Hot Water Pond. Us go there every night. Well, during the summer about nine o\u2019clock, when it\u2019s really cold, but it\u2019s really nice over there. The moon stay shining and just go out. Heck, jump in naked, whatever. \u2018S good fun. No one ever understood me. The way I talked. And so, I thought now that I speak proper English.

So when I was learning how to speak Spanish, I never knew how for speak Spanish before I went there. So I got there, and everyone was like, \u201cOh, I can\u2019t understand you what you stay saying in English.\u201d And I\u2019m like, \u201cOK.\u201d So I started learning Spanish, and all the Hispanic guys thought I was \u2014 I was a native, the way that I talked.

And I spent my, uh, career, most of my career as a computer programmer, systems analyst, computer trainer and, uh, Web developer. And, uh, first memory: The first memory that I think that I have, and I\u2019m not, it\u2019s indistinct but I think it would be, uh, looking up out of a baby basket at a bunch of people looking over the edge and being at a party or something and then all the people would disappear and I would hear noise in the background and I would be alone there in the baby basket, uh waiting for somebody else to look over the edge, I guess. And, uh, on the farm, uh, maybe I could tell a couple of memories on the farm, uh, I yu, I uh, first started driving our, our Farm-all tractor, it was a \u201cB\u201d model; it was a very small tractor and that\u2019s what I learned on and I would pull the hay bailer, and I remember, uh, pulling my dad and my uncle, they were, they would be back pulling bales out of the hay bailer and putting them on the ra- on the uh, flat rack to take into the mow and, uh, my touch on the clutch was not all that good, and sometimes I would jerk the clutch out and they would, uh not fall, but they would be, uh, stumbling for ber- stumbling for balance and I would get a little chewing out for that. Um, I had, uh, hay fever and, uh, was allergic to grain dust, so I was not a good fit for being a farmer, and so after many tight chests and many, uh, many times of, uh, uh, having reactions to that sort of thing, I realized that I would have to do something besides farming, which was good because I didn\u2019t like farming too much anyway."

And my Mom\u2019s freaking out, and my Dad and my brother and I are this is the coolest thing in the world; you know it was amazing. And we went back to the Lodge and told the woman at the desk about this, and she said \u201cYeah, there are goats here, but we don\u2019t see many wolves,\u201d but she mentioned that there had been Alaskan huskies that had gotten lose or free for a while, and it may very well have been them.

Anyway, uh, we had great fun as roommates and did crazy things, uh, living in the dorms as well as just having fun socially with other people during that first year.

Uh, Fulton, Kentucky, is on the s-state line, um, the state line of Tennessee and Kentucky running straight through it. It\u2019s South Fulton, Tennessee, and Fulton, Kentucky. And I actually went to school on the Tennessee side, but I lived my adult years on the Kentucky side. I have lived in Fulton most of my life. Uh, a few years in Saxton, Missouri. The last eleven years I\u2019ve been in Paducah, Kentucky. I\u2019ve been a legal secretary most of my life. For the last eight years I administered federal housing grants, and I\u2019m not working now. In my spare time, I like to sit out on the deck in my hot tub. I just got a new hot tub. [laughs] My dad\u2019s from Dresden, Tennessee, and my mom is from South Fulton, Tennessee. Their parents are from the same area. We have some Irish in us, but we\u2019ve been in these parts for as long as we can remember. We\u2019re descended of Mary Todd Lincoln and Sir Isaac Newton. Um, Paducah has a summer festival each year in addition t\u2019 that we\u2019re also famous for being Quilt City USA. We have a big quilt museum in Paducah that, uh, people flock to every year. Paducah is located approximately one hour west of the Mississippi River. We lay between the Ohio and Tennessee Rivers. We\u2019re \u2018bout two and a half hours away from Nashville, Tennessee, which lies to the east; uh, Memphis, Tennessee, three and a half hours to the south, and we\u2019re \u2018bout twenty minutes away from the home of Superman and the Merv Griffin [laughs], Merv Griffin River Boat, and contrary to popular belief we do wear shoes in Kentucky. And we have some cold winters. We have, uh, probably a high of around a hundred with heat index, a hundred and ten in the summers, and sometimes as cold as twenty degrees below in the winter. Normally though \u2019s low teens in the winter. We have a nuclear plant called Union Carbide. A couple big tire tire plants around. We grow wheat, corn, uh, soybeans, beans, tomatoes, cucumbers, squash, okras \u2026"

    "unscripted_text": "Hello, I\u2019m from the wonderful town of Paducah, Kentucky, located in the western part of Kentucky. Um, as a child growing up, I grew up in a, in a very nice neighborhood. Um, I have two parents: a mother and a father. Uh, my mother is now the head-division human-resource manager of a plant called USIG. Uh, it used to be called Lockheed n\u2019 Martin; before then it was called Union Carbide, so they\u2019ve had a couple mergers, and now they\u2019re called USIG. Uh, my father is, um, he\u2019s a newscaster. He has his own television segment back in Paducah called \u201cBurge\u2019s Bag.\u201d Uh, before it was called \u201cBurge\u2019s Bag\u201d it was called \u201cThe People Beat.\u201d So growing up as a child I got to go on these nice, adventurous excursions with my father to Missouri, Tennessee, Illinois, and those that are, that were in, uh, Kentucky. We would travel around, finding just like little oddities in life, people who have like a three-legged dog that did tricks or caught frisbees. Or a woman that made uh, human sculptures out of pecan shells. Um, so as you can see I had a pretty exciting childhood growing up. I guess my, my favorite People\u2019s Beat or Burge\u2019s Bag story that my father did was when a woman did a sculpture of me singing on the back of a crushed can; it was a recycled can, and, uh, it wuh- it didn\u2019t really look like me, but it was nice to think that she thought it looked like me. Um, I got to do a lot of television, uh, plugs and networking and, uh, radio plugs as I was growing up. My father and I, uh, we\u2019d go do benefits for KET and PBS a lot, which are like local news stations for Kentucky in the, Paducah, uh, viewing area. So I had lots of fun growing up. I would do commercials with my father all the time. I still get teased to this day with my aunt. Uh, there was a commercial that my father and I did for the Paducah Library, and I was like, maybe 5 years old. They used me because I was young and tender \u2014 I didn\u2019t know any better. I had two little, uh, afro puffs in my hair, and I walked over to my father with this big huge like, Encyclopedia Britannica book, and I said \u201cDaddy, read to me!\u201d So to this day, I\u2019m 18 years old and people still rag on me about \u201cDaddy still read to me!\u201d So, um, right now I\u2019m at the University of Louisville; my anticipated major is mass communications. Um, I\u2019m enjoying it a lot. I came to U of L in the summer of 1999. I\u2019m a graduate of the class of 1999. Um, I\u2019m doing theatre right now, which I absolutely love. I did a little bit of theatre back home, but not much. Um, there\u2019s not a strong theatre program back home; I did a couple of community plays but nothing other than that. Um, but here at the University of Louisville I\u2019ve done, I think maybe four productions, and this is just, this\u2019s been, it was in my first semester so I\u2019m pretty, pretty excited about that. I did uh, one play under my director who\u2019s now filming me and she\u2019s now grinning with, uh, with delight. So we had fun doing that. That was my first \u2014 that was my debut here at the University of Louisville as far as my theatre performances. I\u2019m looking forward to do \u2014 doing much more."

    "unscripted_text": "I grew up in south Louisville. Uh, I lived there up until the time \u2014 well, where I grew up I lived up until the time I was 20. Uh, it was working-class neighborhood. When I was growing up, um, there were, most of the mothers were stay-at-home mothers. So you knew, all the, they all knew each other; I knew all the kids growing up, it, you know, it, it was blue collar. You know, so, you know they\u2019re not like a big, you know, bunch of executives or anybody around; it wasn\u2019t like that. Um, I think uh, the dialect in south Louisville differs, uh, from other parts of the east end because most, I think of, of the south end is a family community, whereas a lot of the people that live in other parts of the city, I think, you know, come from other places, and, like, they\u2019re more professionals, and, um, I, I think the south end is, I think most of the people that live in the south end have been there a long time; they\u2019re family has been there, whereas, you know, people that come from other places are just not usually going to gravitate towards the south end. Um, uh, there were a lot of Catholic families on our street, I know I was jealous growing up; all the girls would have first communion and I, I didn\u2019t have first communion because I went to the Methodist church down the street. So\u2019s kind of jealous about that. Um, I went to, uh, Iroquois High School, which is on down Taylor Boulevard. Um, where I live now really isn\u2019t that far, um, from it. I grew up very close to Churchill Downs, which, it, a lot of people would think that\u2019s cool but I look as, at D-Derby day as a day where you were kind of stuck, you couldn\u2019t go anywhere because of all the traffic. And, huh, my husband growing up um, he always went to the Derby and he, he never saw the side of it that I did. I mean, they\u2019d get on the expressway, they\u2019d go in the Downs, they\u2019d park, they had their great box seats right on the rail, would watch the Derby and go home, so, I know that when, um, when we first started dating; we\u2019d go over my mother\u2019s house Derby eve and we\u2019d watch all the traffic going up and down Taylor Boulevard. And he, it fascinated him, I mean he would sit there with his mouth hanging open because he never saw that part of it. He didn\u2019t know how wild it was. I mean he just couldn\u2019t get over all the people, and, you know, so, you know, he saw a different side of it, you know, than what I saw. A, you know, a lot of people, you know, look down on the south end, but it\u2019s very unfortunate, I mean you can g-get beautiful homes in the south end; I think the cost o\u2019 living is, I m- it-, it\u2019s the same, but you can get a house comparable to a house out on the east end for less money. I\u2019m close to work, I mean it\u2019s, you know, it\u2019s, it\u2019s very handy for me."

    "unscripted_text": "I guess you could say I was raised as a farm boy. I grew up on a farm, small rural area. I guess my closest friends were a mile away. Did have\u2019s a couple friends, though I saw some as a child every now and then they would come over. Moanly \u2014 mainly, I remember, uh, feeding the pigs, getting hay, cutting wood, feeding the chickens, getting the chicken eggs outta there. I hated that; chickens would always wanta peck ya when you was trying to get the eggs. I didn\u2019t like that \u2018specially if they were setting to raise the little chickens \u2014 you\u2019d have the whole pile of eggs under our hen, and, uh, she wouldn\u2019t even want ya to touch \u2018em. Then, uh, slopping the pigs, of course, that that was always bad. We used to go to the closest elementary school, and after all the kid\u2019s meals that they ate that day they\u2019d put all the food into buckets for us, and we would bring five-gallon buckets out to the farm, and I would feed \u2018em to the pigs at night. And the horses, I remember the horses a lot. I really loved horses; they were really great. Horses were almost like people if you had them to do go do whatever there chore was a time or two, they could do it by themselves. Mainly, I remember when we was cutting cedar logs; we used to cut these logs, and I would hook up the horses you would have a doubletree, that\u2019s what it\u2019s called, so you could hook two horses together; then they would go to one chain to pull the logs. I used to ride on this double tree; it reminded me like I was, uh, in a chariot or something. I felt like I was, ya know, like in the ancient times riding in a chariot out through the woods; it felt really great. And like I said, the horses were so smart that after a few trips they could go for a half mile or a mile on their own and you would just have one person to hook them up on one end where the trees were, and the other at your other end where the wagon was, and the horses would do all the work for you. They would just go back and forth. All you had to do was hook them up, and no one would have to be with them. They were really smart. We had a horse called Joe, O- Jo we called him, and Roney. I think O-Jo would probably been hurt before we got him because he was really scared when we first got him, and if you rattled wire around him he would jump and stuff; we felt like someone had probably beat him with barbed wire, but he grew out of that, and he became our best horse but he still was destined to die. He, uh, got shot. Some people were visiting a neighbor of ours one day this guy that had just gotten out of prison, and he got a gun and shot our horse, and he shot him and killed him. And that was the end of Joe, and this was a really great horse. And then, uh, what else was growing up on the farm; the farm was filled with a lot of good things, though, that was the sad thing. But the good things way outweighed the sad things that happened. We\u2019d go hunting at night and spend all night hunting, and then the dogs would get lost and spend most of the time the hunting would be hunting the dogs, the no-good dogs, of course. The good dogs always would come back every night, but the no-good dogs would be hunting raccoon, but they would decide they wanted to chase a deer, and deers run really fast so your dog goes miles away in one night so you\u2019re like looking for three or four days at a time to try and find your dog. And that was most of what hunting turned into being: hunting the dogs instead of hunting the animal. And then, uh, back to the pigs. The pigs were nasty, like I said, but they had the best meat, ya know; we fresh coat our farm animals, the chickens and the pigs, and the pigs I was always the one who wound up doing the killing, and I would shoot them, but the way you shoot them you make a cross between their ears and their eyes, and right in the center point is where you shoot; that way the pig there\u2019s no pain; it just goes down. It shot it right in the brain instead. Then we would cut, we would hang them up and gut them and then scald them in these big pans. And, uh, I know it sounds all horrid to whoever may be listening to this, but it is the way it\u2019s really done, and I don\u2019t do it anymore; I go to the store and buy my food now, but I remember the last thing I ever killed was a, a rabbit. I was a really great shot. I was really good with a rifle. My brother, he knew I didn\u2019t want to hunt anymore so he bet me one day that I couldn\u2019t shoot this rabbit. It was like a hundred fifty yards away; of course I hit it, killed it, just fell over. That\u2019s the last animal I ever killed. It\u2019s like I don\u2019t wanna kill animals no more. Even though it was so much of my existence, and our food we weren\u2019t just hunting animals for trophies, we ate them. You know, this was real existence. And but I just didn\u2019t want to do it no more. It\u2019s like I would rather find some way to make the money and buy it at the store and not have to go through the killing you\u2019re supposed to, killing your own animals. Even though the meat, I believe, is better; it\u2019s more fresh, and it does have a lot better taste, I rather go to the store. \u2026"

I went to black schools; I went to, uh, the community center. That was my favorite part of the living in the projects because living there, you know, I learned how to \u2014 in the center, we had cooking schools, we had sewing classes, we had the choir, we had skating, we had everything that could keep you in that community where we were supposed to stay anyway. So, it was all right growing up there, and I loved that. It was Grace Presbyterian Center. That\u2019s where I spent my entire evening, in that center. And I learned to sing, I learned to sew, I learned to cook, and I learned to play, and I learned to have fun. And I attended Booker T. Washington. That was from the first th\u2019u the sixth grade. And it set right beside Jackson Junior High School, which is now Meyzeek, and it\u2019s integrated now, but when I went it was just an all-black school. An\u2019 I went there one year, and that was, uh, sixth or seventh grade, and then we had to leave the projects because my mother got sick. She caught, uh, tuberculosis. So we moved with my grandmother for a whole year, which was a whole move from the east end. I don\u2019t know if you would call it the west end, but we was at 24 Vincesne [spelling?]. She was running a boarding home that she was buyin\u2019, so she rented out rooms. So we moved in with her, and my mother went to the sanitarium, Hazelwood Sanitarium, to stay for a year, n\u2019 we stayed with my grandmother. There I went to Madison Junior High School, which is now part of C. Russell, and it was an all-black school. I didn\u2019t care for that school too much; it was rowdy, really rowdy. So I sort of stayed to myself. And when my mother came out of the hospital, she went into, uh, LPN training, to become a nurse, and we moved over on Cedar Street, and I started into Central High School. Life really begin to pick up then, but it was still segregated; we still was all black, but my mother was makin\u2019 better money, and we bought a home: 1523 Beach, and, uh, that was the best time of my life."

Um, my favorite story is, uh, one \u2026 the first year I was \u2026 rode in the parades on Mardi Gras Day. Um, it starts off you get up at 4 o\u2019clock in the morning. You have to get in costume. You have to get on the float.

And this one Mardi Gras, the first year, uh, my parents had spent, oh, about four-hundred dollars on beads and stuff for me to throw. And before the parade even started, I had given away about half of my beads, to, to people just walkin\u2019 up and down the site. I wasn\u2019, maybe, 14 years old at the time. And, my parents just got angry, because I, I didn\u2019t have much left to throw. By the halfway through the parade, I was diggin\u2019 in their bags and other peoples\u2019 bags. But I \u2026 it was really fun. We had, uh, that was my first experience in, um \u2026 that was a parade called Zulu, which is a all African-American parade. It\u2019s the only African parade in Mardi Gras, so, that was, um, my first adventures in Mardi Gras. It was wild. They had people lined up, showing, uh, body parts to me for beads and stuff.

I have a little brother and a little sister, and we lived in the lower 9th Ward. Um, I went to Catholic schools throughout my life, even through college. Um, my major is pharmacy, and I was a student at Xavier University of Louisiana, before the storm. As a result of the storm, I ended up at the University of Louisiana at LaFayette, which is a way bigger campus than Xavier, and I\u2019m not really used to walkin\u2019 around, \u2019cause everything\u2019s within walking distance, you know, it\u2019s not that far. The classes are fine, but I think it\u2019s just a hard transition not being able to start school from the beginning. So it\u2019s like you have to play catch-up. It\u2019s really, really hard. And I\u2019m used to makin\u2019 good grades, and that season my grades are like Cs, instead of As and Bs that I\u2019m used to getting, but, I mean, the transition was really hard, so, I\u2019m happy I\u2019m just passing. Yes, I\u2019ve made a lot of friends. Um, there\u2019s one girl \u2014 we go out a lot. \u2019Cause I normally just stay in my room. I don\u2019t really go anywhere, \u2019cause I don\u2019t know anything too much, but she shows me around, and we go out to eat an-, or the movies, or we go bowlin\u2019. It\u2019s just like bein\u2019 in New Orleans, the only difference is: New Orleans, everythin\u2019 stays open [laughs] way later than in LaFayette. Um, yes, my brother and my sister are also in LaFayette. Um, my brother was goin\u2019 to all-boy high school, and now he attends a co-ed high school, which is, um, LaFayette High. My sister was also in Catholic school, and she\u2019s at S.J. Montgomery Elementary, and she\u2019s 8, so she\u2019s havin\u2019 a hard time. She misses her friends; she was a cheerleader, and she doesn\u2019t get to do the things she used to do in New Orleans. My brother, sh- he\u2019s just happy he gets to go to school with girls, so he\u2019s pretty much OK. My parents are fine. My dad is a carpenter, so he goes back and forth, from New Orleans to LaFayette, and from LaFayette back to New Orleans with my fianc\u00e9, who\u2019s a New Orleans police officer. So, we, um, get to see him like every other weekend, but I\u2019m so used to my dad bein\u2019 in the house with me. So it\u2019s kinda hard, \u2019cause I live on campus now, and I\u2019m not with my family all the time. And my mom\u2019s havin\u2019 a hard time, \u2019cause she\u2019s used to goin\u2019 to work, and now she doesn\u2019t have a job, so she has to find things to busy herself with. But my mom was a home health-care nurse, in New Orleans. Well, actually, it was the Metairie area, but, pretty much it\u2019s all one big area. They just have different sections called different things, but to me it\u2019s all New Orleans."

And in the neighborhood, you wouldn\u2019t expect to meet so many nice people, but they were all there. And after eighth grade, graduating and everything, decided to go to high school, and I attended a historically black school called St. Mary\u2019s Academy. I didn\u2019t want to go there, but I had to make the best of it. It was a part of my history, my family history. My mom went there for high school, so she wanted to keep the tradition going, I guess you can say. Um, I graduated from St.Mary\u2019s Academy in 2003, and from there I decided to go to Dillard University, also in New Orleans. At Dillard, my major was nursing. I\u2019ve always wanted to be a nurse. Well, not really. I wanted to be a, a pediatrician, and I was like, \u201cWell, maybe that\u2019s too many years of school.\u201d So, I downgraded to bein\u2019 a neonatal nurse, \u2019cause I love babies. I think they\u2019re like God\u2019s gift to every person who can have a kid. Kids are beautiful. Um, when I went to Dillard, for \u2014 I want to say about \u2014 this would have been my third year.

It\u2019s like, really hard; it\u2019s confusing. You know, I\u2019ve never been so stressed in my whole entire life. But I, I guess out of all of this, I\u2019ve learned how to appreciate life, how to be thankful, just for breathing every day. You know, because I, I could have been, you know, still in New Orleans, struggling with everybody else, tryin\u2019 to survive. But I was blessed that God gave me another chance, and he was like, \u201cYou can do it, you can do it.\u201d So I\u2019m tryin\u2019 to make the best out of this.

We picked blackberries in the summer and, uh swam, and did very country kind of things. And grew up with lots of family around always; and I was a tomboy, my cousin was a tomboy, so we had a great time growing up. I hated school. I liked recess and P.E. and playing sports after school. I hated lunch. And then I went into New Orleans for high school and college. And met my husband at a college in New Orleans. And I was 18 then. And uh \u2026 we wound up moving to New Orleans when we got married when I was 23, and had my first baby in New Orleans in Gentilly. And then we moved to Metairie in a move to the suburbs and had our second baby, and then we moved to the North Shore, uh, across Lake Ponchartrain, and we\u2019ve been for about thirty years, and I\u2019m 61 now. And I love to play tennis, and I have six grandchildren and they\u2019re so much fun; and I\u2019ve been married 38 years; and I love being married now; you, um, you appreciate it more when you get older. And, uh, I miss my parents dearly. I have a sister and a brother, um, who I treasure, especially with my parents gone. My dad and \u2026 my mom and dad were both from New Orleans; and um, his father was from LeHavre, France. And my dad didn\u2019t speak English \u2018til he went to school. He spoke\u2026they spoke French at home. And they\u2026they had a very close family too.

    "unscripted_text": "I was born at Mercy Hospital in Portland, Maine, actually right across the street from the church at which I was christened. Uh, I\u2019ve grown up in Falmouth, Maine, my entire life, which is the first town north of Portland. Uh, it\u2019s a pretty small town. It\u2019s right around 8,000 people. Uh, went to \u2014 my high school was right around 600, when I graduated. My class was, I think a hundred and 32. I was \u2014 it\u2019s a small enough town that I \u2026 knew pretty much everybody in the high school, and I had group of friends that I grew up knowing, and most \u2026 By the time, they were \u2026 People moved in and out, but pretty much they\u2019re the same group of people I grew up with my entire life. I summered in Downeast Maine, uh, on an island called Burnt Island, which is off the north end of a larger island called Isle Lahoe, in Penobscot Bay. Um, Isle Au Haut is where my mother and father met, an\u2019 fell in love, an\u2019 got married, and had my older brother, an\u2019 shortly after realized that it\u2019s not necessary a \u2014 necessarily the proper place to raise a child, because education an\u2019\u2026 Economically it just wasn\u2019t very smart. So they moved off the island, after my father and mother having lived there for eight years, and moved down to the Portland area \u2019n\u2019 found a house in Falmouth, where my mother has lived ever since. Uh, the Downeast accent is, well, the sort of northern New England dialect I always, I, t\u2013 you can hear it all over the state but obviously, called Downeast. I think it would obvious, pretty much originated in Downeast Maine, which I\u2019m sure sort of a strange term, \u2019s people who\u2019ve never really been to Maine wouldn\u2019t really understand. You have to \u2026 from where I live, you have to go north, and then you have to go east, and then you have to go south again, to get to Downeast Maine, because, if you tried to drive directly there from where I would, you\u2019d be driving across water. You have to go north and east and down, so, hence the term Downeast, I think. It\u2019s a very rural, not \u2014 very sparse population. I mean, the state of Maine is huge, and there are only a million people that live there, roughly, so it\u2019s, uh, the Downeast Maine is very rural. The part that I grew up in \u2014 Portland area \u2014 is really only the popula\u2013 heavily populated area. Um, in Downeast Maine, there\u2019re lots of blue-collar people that are living, fishing. Uh, obviously, lumber is a major thing in Maine, is what I think our number one economic resource. Eh, but it\u2019s, it\u2019s a beautiful place, and there\u2019s lots o\u2013 lots of people living there that, uh,you know, it\u2019s, it\u2019s hard; it\u2019s not an easy life to live in Downeast Maine there. The winters are harsh, especially on the water. Uh, the food, and lobstering\u2019s one of the very, very hard. It\u2019s lots of work, long hours and, uh, definitely not a whole lot of reward. There\u2019s money to be made there, but it\u2019s, it\u2019s not without lots and lots of hard work.

My father at the time was working in a factory; my mother was a housewife. However, she had been working in a telephone office before her marriage and she, when my youngest, when my brother became 5 years old she went back to work for the phone company. And my mother always worked, and I remember her having a basketball team. My father also owned an island on Damariscotta Lake, which was about eight miles from the place where we lived because we were right on the edge of the lake where I was born. The house belonged to my grandparents, and I was born there in the front room. My father got the island that he owned by eminent domain; nobody wanted the islands on the lake at that time; property was only worth something because you had animals and they could drink water out of the lake. My father and seven or eight other guys who were friend of his built a small camp there, and it\u2019s the camp, camp that we\u2019re still using and that was probably in 1913. The chimney was built the day after I was a year old; that would be 1916. Ah, yes, I remember going to Big Pine, which was another island that was owned by a man by the name of Glidden, and he had abandoned the place because he didn\u2019t have any money, and I can remember my father showing me a boat that they had in the boathouse there, and he lifted me up over the side of it and told me to remember it because I\u2019d never see anything like it again. And it was uh, that, uh, vacuum; I can\u2019t remember the name now, but anyhow it had all kinds of petcocks and screws and [laughter] all kinds of things on it."

An\u2019 I had \u2026 uh, my mom was 19, an\u2019 she had three kids. So I have two older brothers, and I have a younger sister \u2019t\u2019s four years younger than me. So the boys were three years apart. Each of us are a year apart, the three of us, an\u2019 then four years later, a sister was born. So it\u2019s four of us. An\u2019 then we moved to another part of Howard County when I was 4. We lived there about a year, an\u2019 then my parents bought a house in Baltimore. My dad was a mechanic, auto mechanic. An\u2019 then he worked the farm, but when he didn\u2019t wanna work the farm any more he went into the mechanic business full time, Chevrolet cars. So, we\u2019ll belong now. So then we moved to Baltimore when I was \u2014 I think I was 7 when we moved there, an\u2019 it was just a normal \u2026 we walked everywhere. You could walk anywhere. Or you could get a bus. My mother worked downtown at the Hecht Company, so she would get the bus, and we\u2019d go down there on Saturdays shoppin\u2019 at Hecht\u2019s, called it Hecht\u2019s then; that shows you my age. An\u2019, um, that was fun, but we just basically went to school, teen center, that kind o\u2019 stuff. Vacations weren\u2019t real exciting because we usually just went to places like Gettysburg, which was a big trip when you lived in Baltimore. [Interviewer: That\u2019s great.] Now I\u2019m getting\u2019 ready to move that way it\u2019s really comical. [Interviewer laughs.] \u2019N that\u2019s where my husband Al is from \u2026 [Interviewer: From Gettysburg?] from \u2014 is \u2014 yes, Gettysburg, PA. He never toured Gettysburg till I met him, an\u2019 then I made him go on tours. I said, \u201cYou don\u2019t live in Gettysburg and not tour it.\u201d But I was like, um, bus ride. You could get on the bus and be downtown, where it\u2019s [the] Inner Harbor now, but it wasn\u2019t there years ago. [Interviewer: Uh-huh]. An\u2019 like ten minutes, you were right down there. I was tryin\u2019 to think, \u2019cause like nothin\u2019 really exciting, exciting happened, other than when I went to the Bulmer Civic Center and saw Elvis Presley, which was like my highlight. [Noise from interviewer] Do you like \u2019im? [Interviewer: I love him.] Oh, OK. [Both laugh.] \u2019Cause it was wonderful. An\u2019 it was before he got sick an\u2019 the drugs took over an\u2019 everything, so he looked good and it was like proba\u2019ly the most \u2026 that was proba\u2019ly one of the most exciting things besides having three kids that I\u2019ve ever done. Because we were real gutsy at that age. I think I was like 17, so we went out \u2014 we followed their limo from downtown Baltimore out to the airport. An\u2019 I lived ten minutes from Bal\u2013 BWI Airport, so we used to hang out there. [Interviewer: At the airport?] Yes, that\u2019s our hangout. Saturday night didn\u2019t cost anything. An\u2019 we used to go there, an\u2019 I, an\u2019 I met like Brooks Robinson there, from the Baltimore Orioles. I sat with him while he was waitin\u2019 for a plane. \u2019Cause my friends bet I wouldn\u2019t have the nerve to go up to him, and you don\u2019t bet me anything. At that age, you didn\u2019t bet me anything."

So I consider myself very fortunate because all my parents loved me. I had a brother by my father and stepmother, and I had a sister by my mother and stepfather, and, um, when I was 17 years old I was with my girlfriend in the car we went to one of these drive-in, um, um, um, food places where they like, ya know, come out and take your order and put the thing on the side of the car, ya know very fifties, but it was actually in 1964, and, um, all of a sudden this car pulled in beside us and there were these two really cute guys in there and, and one asked me my name, and I told him it was Jackie, and I said, \u201cWhat\u2019s yours?\u201d and he goes K Knoreline, and I almost threw up in the back of my throat, but then he said he was just kidding so we, um, started talking. He asked me to go on a date, and we\u2019ve been together ever since. That was forty-three years ago August the seventh. Let me see, what else? Have I traveled a lot? Well, we lived a lot of places when I was growing up; my dad lived all over the East Coast, so of course I spent summers and whenever I could with him, and I would never move out and, and after were married my husband went into the Navy during Vietnam and we did some traveling into Dallas, and we moved to San Diego, California, for two-and-a-half years. Um, so ya, we traveled around quite a bit. We\u2019ve been a lot of places on the East Coast, um, some that we frequent, like Cape Cod, and, um, ya know last summer we took a trip out west, and we did some remote to Phoenix and stopped in a lot of wonderful places and went back to San Diego, where we lived when my husband was in the service."

Our family read by gaslight, and Mom cooked on a coal stove and a gas stove, which often ran out of gas in the middle of preparing supper. But not to worry: An oil lamp and matches were kept close by. Meanwhile, Dad would get a quarter out of an old sugar bowl, and sometimes he would put me on his shoulder and let me drop the coin in the meter in the hallway. One memorable day some workmen arrived to install the wires for electricity. I remember sitting on the brick sidewalk, dangling my feet through the cellar window as I watched them work. The fixtures they put in the parlor had beautiful orange frosted globes that cast a warm glow, and I\u2019m sure that is why, to this day, orange is my favorite color. From Boston, I lived there for eight years. Then we went maybe thirty miles to Quincy, which was on the water, and I spent the next twenty-one years there. And then we moved inland a bit again to Braintree, Mass., which is \u2026 was maybe fifteen or twenty miles away, and we spent twenty-three years there."

    "unscripted_text": "I would like to talk about where I grew up. Probably, from \u2026 up until age, say, 12, I grew up in Andover, Massachusetts, which is approximately 24 miles north of Boston, and about less than 10 miles from the New Hampshire border, and not that far from Maine. And we grew up in this little town of Andover, and we lived in my grandfather\u2019s home, because, whe\u2013 \u2026 The day my mom got married, her mom passed away, so my mom was left to care for her father. And it was during World War II, and her sisters and brothers had all gone off to war and what not, so that\u2019s how it transpired that we stayed in my grandfather\u2019s home, which is in Baker\u2019s Lane in little old downtown Andover. It was a wonderful place to grow up. We had a lot of kids, and it was a little dead-end lane. And in our home in particular, we had \u2014 or my grandfather grew \u2014 cottage roses, along the side fence. We had our own apple tree. We had a pear tree. We had our own sliding hill, that went down into this swampy area which was a feed-off from the Shawsheen River. And, the older kids \u2026 they had some trees that were downed, and they would tie this huge rope around the downed trees, so that it would hang into the water. So in the winter, when it froze, we could ice skate. And the younger kids could hold onto the rope, so they wouldn\u2019t fall. It would help them to work into their balance, of ice-skating. It was really neat, and kind of nice of them to think of, for little kids. So we \u2014 without even leaving our street, we could sled, we could ice skate. We had a pear tree, which we ate the pears; um, the apple tree. We had wild berries. We had this great big, huge crate, that was like a, a, a huge box, but it was more made of wood, and I had, um, bunny cages in there, and, um, it just was a neat place to grow up. My best friend growing up was, um, Michael O\u2019Hagen. And his mom had died right after he was born, so \u2026 he wa\u2013 he came to live with his grandmother who lived at the en\u2013 the beginning of the lane. We lived at the end of the lane. So, Michael was my, my childhood friend. We played in this huge sandbox, that we had in our backyard, every single day. We played in our sandbox, and then we would go up the hill to the Indian Ridge playground, and all the kids would be there at the playground doing \u2014 you know, arts and crafts, you know, ball games, card games, whatever was happening. And then, up the street from where we lived were, was a variety store called Chicki\u2019s. And Chicki and Lou, they ran it. They were Armenian. And they had this glass case with all this penny candy. And you would go there every day, with your penny. And you would just peer into that glass case and think, \u201cWhat will I buy today?\u201d It was the biggest adventure every day. [Laughs] It was so inexpensive, but you thought it was this grand: I don\u2019t know, this grand escape. And you never had to cross a street. It was just a delight. And we were just, maybe, a bit shy of the railroad tracks, with, you know, the train would come and take people into Boston and what not. And the other side of the tracks was another store, called Ricky\u2019s. So there was Ricky\u2019s and Chicki\u2019s on either side of the tracks. [Squawk of laughter] But Ricky\u2019s had, um, more of a sandwich bar, and on Friday\u2019s people would go there for their, um, their fish, their fried fish dinners. Because two stores up was St. Augustin\u2019s Church, which dominated the area. Although I was a Protestant. [Laughs] The Catholic church was very \u2014 you know, it \u2014 you were very aware of it."

    "unscripted_text": "OK, I was born in Somerville, which is a city just outside of Boston. I was born in, uh, 1958, and then grew up in a town called Burlington, which is just north of the city. I went to Burlington High School, and, uh, I graduated in 1977, and then I went into the Marine Corps, the United States Marine Corps in 1979, and then I, uh, got out in 2000. I retired in 2000. And, um, I spent my first four years in San Diego, at camp P\u2013 I was an MP, military police. And, uh, I spent my first four years at Camp Pendleton, which is in San Diego. And, uh, then I went to Kaniowi, which is in Hawaii, spent three years at the Kaneowi Marine Corps Air Station. From there I went to San Antonio,Texas and taught at MP school. Um, I was there from \u201989\u2013 no, wait a minute, \u201986 to \u201989. Then I came home to Boston on recruiting duty, which was my best duty in the Marine Corps, I loved it. Got to come home. Uh, left recruiting duty for a year in Japan, half that time I spent in Korea. Then I came back from Korea to Quantico, Virginia, which is just outside of DC. And then I retired in 2000, and I\u2019ve been here at Harvard since April of 2000. I\u2019m a police officer. Well, it\u2019s our job here at Harvard to make sure the students that come here \u2014 as you know, they\u2019re going to the finest institution in the world, and as a police officer, it\u2019s our job to make sure that they can come here, get the best education known to man or woman, to do it in an environment that\u2019s safe, and to have a little fun. I always thought that the Marine Corps was set a little bit \u2014 I saw that they were respected. I saw that, you know, that kids that I knew and just the general public, you know, respects the Marine Corps. Because, you know, this country doesn\u2019t need the Marine Corps. I mean, the Army can fulfill the mission that the Marine Corps has. The reason that the Marine Corps\u2019s still around is because the American people want the Marine Corps. I don\u2019t know if you ever knew that, but yes, they did. I don\u2019t know. It was somethin\u2019 different. It was something that not a lot of other kids my age could say that they\u2019ve done. Hey, look, I could have easily made a left instead of a right in my life, and I thought that the Marine Corps taught me to grow up, to be a man, to respect people, to be more responsible, and it was something that, um, it\u2019s hard to explain. We had a saying the Marine Corps, it\u2019s called Semper Fidelis, which means you\u2019re always faithful to the Corps. And I think, going through those three months on Parris Island, no matter what else I do in my life, it has set me up for that. Because when I look back on it, I always say \u2014 and I\u2019m sure that you had some kind of recruit training too, so you can understand where I\u2019m comin\u2019 from. So, after those three months, no matter what challenges I come across in my life, I always feel that I can handle that, because that kind of set me up for it. And, um, God forbid, if we have to go to war, I want to go with the Marine Corps. I think that, if you\u2019re makin\u2019 a film, and you\u2019re doing it, like \u201cGood Will Hunting,\u201d or a film that\u2019s situated here in Boston, you absolutely have to get the accent righ, \u2018cause if you don\u2019t, then it seems like a fraud film, \u2019cause anyone that lives back here hears it right away, whether it\u2019s a good storyline, you got the right cast, the right actors, as soon as you hear that accent and it\u2019s not right, then it just like \u2014 it just like \u2014 you didn\u2019t do your homework. You have to kind of be from Boston to hear the actual dialect. It\u2019s not something you can point your finger at. It\u2019s somethin\u2019\u2013 you know it when you see it, you know what I mean? And you know it when you hear it. And I think, with our accent, I think it\u2019s like, when you leave Boston, when you go to other parts of the country, people want to hear you talk. I think for the most part, it\u2019s, uh, like me, from bein\u2019 from Boston, I love the Southern accent. It\u2019s respectful and it\u2019s quiet and it\u2019s, it\u2019s polished. And I think when you get away from Boston that people pick up on that, and they like the accent. \u2019Cause you can\u2019t go anywhere. Like, if I go to California, and I go through the drive-through, and I\u2019ll say, \u201cListen, I want a large \u2026 I want a large coffee with cream and sugar.\u201d So the box will come off and it\u2019ll say, \u201cUh, could you please repeat your order?\u201d I\u2019ll say, \u201cYes, I\u2019d like a large coffee with cream and sugar.\u201d Then I\u2019ll hear like a little giggling from the box, and then they\u2019ll say, \u201cSir, can you come to the window?\u201d And then when I come to the window, there\u2019ll be like you know, a couple people at the window just to look at me to see what this accent\u2019s all about."

And then, basically I was just raised in East Cambridge, and [laughs] guess I\u2019ve still been here. When we moved here, there was very little Portuguese people here.

I work with children in the school, teaching about fire safety. Uh, next, next week I will be doing a camp at the Middlesex County Sheriff\u2019s Department, uh, which is taking inner-city kids and giving them one more week before they go back to school. I teach them about fire safety, first aid, uh, and a little bit about the police department also. I gotta tell ya, one of the first fires that I was involved in, while bein\u2019 a firefighter, uh, was the second day that I worked. We had probably the largest fire that we\u2019ve had in the city, uh, which was an eight-alarm fire. Uh, our truck was first-due truck, so we were the first truck that was there to, uh, go into the houses and check to see if there was anyone in there. Uh, after we got out of one house that we\u2019d checked, that all went up in flames. So as soon as we got in there, and we got out maybe five, ten minutes, that house was fully involved. So that was one of the stories that, uh, that I hold dear to my heart, because it, uh, safety-wise, and \u2026 like I said, just bein\u2019 on two days, to see a big fire like that. Um, tell you another story: I teach fire safety in the schools. I go around, uh, teachin\u2019 them how to do stop-drop-and-roll, how to call 911 and when to call 911. And I really got involved as soon as I got on the fire department, so I hold it very dear to my heart. Uh, I think it\u2019s a good way of lettin\u2019 kids know when to do things and when not to do things, and also, in case you get an emergency, who to call and when to call. It has helped a lot. It has cut down on fires in the city, uh, over 50 percent. Actually, the numbers are actually higher than that, uh, more like 75-80 percent. So, it\u2019s a good program that we\u2019ve had for about 13 years now."

I\u2019ve been to Europe probably once, but, uh, that\u2019s about it. And for, um, for high school \u2026 I mean, when I was young I went to school in my neighborhood. I went to Catholic school, and then I went to private school in the suburbs, and that was different from, from where I grew up, because \u2026 And that was really different from, from where I grew up, um, just because people didn\u2019t live as close to each other and stuff. Um, right now, I am gonna be a senior in college, and I am working on my thesis, and just getting ready to enjoy my last year. In high school, my friends all lived in the suburbs, where I lived in the city, and that was different because, um, everyone \u2014 their houses were a lot bigger than mine was. They all lived in single-family houses and had big backyards, you know, with all kinds o\u2019, you know, dogs and cats, and, you know, that type of thing. And my neighborhood, it\u2019s basically, you know a lot of us live in two- or three-family houses. And, you know, it\u2019s a lot of people living right on top of each other. So it\u2019s different, um, but nice; I like it. Also, um, what\u2019s different about living, living in the city, um, as opposed to the suburbs, a lot of \u2014 a lot of my friends who lived in the suburbs, their parents weren\u2019t from Massachusetts, whereas mine had grown up near me, and all of my aunts and uncles and cousins live, you know, within \u2014 some of \u2019em even within the same block as me. Um, so it\u2019s fun, you know, walkin\u2019 around, you know, runnin\u2019 into people. You know, I\u2019ve been \u2014 I\u2019ve been \u2014 I\u2019ve been driving around in my neighborhood and definitely run into some of my younger cousins, um, driving their bikes in the middle of the street. Almost hitting them, and then yelling at them for it. But yeah, that\u2019s family life in an urban neighborhood, I guess. So, yeah, I was saying, um, about my accent. Even though I\u2019ve \u2014 I\u2013 I\u2019ve always lived basically the same house my whole life, um, you know, I \u2014 when I went to school to the suburbs and all that stuff, where I, um, I definitely, you know, I stuck out like a sore thumb. And so I \u2014 you know, I still even \u2014 you know it\u2019s weird now, you know, I definitely picked up, um, you know, a lot of the R\u2019s and stuff like that. And, you know, even now, it\u2019s weird, \u2019cause I find myself when I\u2019m in \u2026 when I\u2019m in, talking to someone I don\u2019t really know, or if it\u2019s, you know, a person of authority or something like that, you know. Or if I\u2019m addressing a group of people or something, I try really hard to use my R\u2019s and all that stuff. You know, it\u2019s, it\u2019s weird. It depends on the kind of person I\u2019m around, you know, where they\u2019re from and stuff like that. Um, and even like a couple years ago, you know, when I started dating my boyfriend, um, I spent so much time with him that, um, you know, he has a different accent, but he was convinced that I was picking up the accent that, you know, uh, that he had in there for, you know, his, his parents, and his family\u2019s accent as well. Sort of, you know, he thought it was like transmitted to me through him or something, but, yeah."

And (uh) I\u2019m one of seven children, and (uh) we went to parochial schools, (um) the whole family. And then I went to (uh) public high school. But I was (uh) born in, in Boston, the Dorchester section, grew up in (uh) more or less an Irish neighborhood. Generally the, the area was (uh) mostly three-deckers, and these, these three-deckers were (uh) typically five-room, five-room houses. Five, five rooms and (uh) three floors \u2026 be a kitchen, two bedrooms, (uh) the, a dining room and a living room, or a parlor, they used to call it in the old days. And in my particular family, with all that, with nine people, the (uh) dining room became (uh), became a bedroom for my parents. Well I went to after (uh\u2026uh) getting out of grammar school\u2013 parochial grammar school, I went to a (uh) public high school. It was a technical school, where we (uh) \u2014 we had (uh) various, various shops. (Um) You could take a college course if you wanted to. I took a college course for a couple years, then I got into a technical course. I had drafting for four years. I had woodworking courses, sheet metal courses, (uh) machine shop courses, and (uh) after getting out of (uh) \u2014 graduated from high school, I got a job at a civil engineering company as (uh) what they called in those days was a plan clerk. And you just (uh) took drawings to the printers and had them make copies, ran (uh) \u2014 did various messenger work. And eventually I (uh) started on as a junior draftsman. And continued on in (uh) \u2014 the next process was to become a regular draftsman. And there was some large \u2014 in those days these were basically civil engineering companies who were building highways. These employees were, if they were employed, were two, three hundred employees. And I did that for several years, and then I went and (uh) \u2014 I went to work for a (uh) map company for a while. I stayed there maybe for a year or two. That was pretty tedious work. They\u2019d call Leroy, and just Leroying street names all day wasn\u2019t too (uh) \u2014 wasn\u2019t too adventurous. So, shortly after that, I (uh) I went to work for a structural engineer, and that was a little more \u2014 that was something new for me. It would\u2019ve been \u2014 that was more diversified, and (uh) I stayed there for (uh) maybe 30, 35 years. Till the place actually went out of business. I then went to work at Harvard University, as a groundskeeper, and (uh) I\u2019ve been there for maybe about eleven years now. Growing up in Dorchester, it was (uh) preliminary \u2014 (Uhb-uh) Typically it was (uh) basically an Irish \u2014 (uh) an Irish neighborhood. (Uh) There wasn\u2019t an awful lot of money around. (Uh) Most of the immigrants came here with (uh) not an awful lot of education. But they\u2019re extremely (uh) hard workers. And we lived (uh) close to the beach. Y\u2019know we spent an awful lot of time at the beach. If we weren\u2019t at the beach, we were (uh) at the ballpark. Sports was (uh) \u2014 sports was very central to our lives in those days. There wasn\u2019t much \u2014 there were no th\u2013 (uh) we had no automobiles, so you either went to the park, or you went to the beach, or you hung around the corner. (Uh) Typically (uh) the park and the beach were a little more fun. I\u2019m sure our parents encouraged the kids get involved in sports. \u201cKeep the boy in sports, and keep him out of the courts,\u201d was (uh) \u2014 was somethin\u2019 that they said in those days, that\u2019s turned out to be, be pretty truthful. And then we would (uh) \u2014 we would occasionally go \u2014 two months there we\u2019d go to the beach. We\u2019d go to Castle Island. It was a place where\u2013 where the Irish immigrants would meet. And (uh) you would\u2013 you would wander around Castle Island. The airport was there, and the boats were there, and it was a place where people would gather also. But it was also a place you could go walk around and enjoy the ocean. And it (uh) \u2014 it was fairly close to home. As I say, since there were no automobiles. But (uh) and it\u2019s still \u2014 it was at the time called \u2014 called the Irish Riviera. That\u2019s what most of the people in Dorchester area and Southie would, would go. And it (uh) \u2014 it hasn\u2019t changed. The generations (uh) still \u2014 still go there. And (uh) it\u2019s been a focal point of the Boston Irish (uh) people for a, for an awful long time. Yeah, I grew up in Dorchester, but (uh) typically right near the (uh), right near the (uh) South Boston line. We spent (uh) as much of our youth down at the (uh), the ballparks and the beach, which are in South Boston. And (uh), and, and, as I say, typically, my time, my time was spent in Southie, and when I went to high school, I (uh) had, had a bunch of friends.

However, I think that, when I went to Indiana University, um, and maybe even a little bit before that, when I was working in a, a touristy section of Mexico, um, I just got really frustrated with the stigma that I feel like the South Boston accent brought on.

And it\u2019s something that began when I was growing up in Port Huron, which is a, a small town that\u2019s about sixty miles northeast of Detroit in what is called the thumb area of Michigan. Uh, there are two hamburger places in town that had been there forever. I mean long before I was born. In fact, I think my mother had looked at one of them as a child. They were called, um, Powers Hamburger. That was \u2014 for some reason \u2014 apparently the name of the person who had begun them. And they\u2019re the typical white-tiled, very small hamburger diner with, uh, uh, counter seating for maybe a dozen people and maybe a couple seats along the glass and usually a pinball machine and, uh, and, uh, some kind of jukebox arrangement. And they usually served breakfast and all manner of things. But their specialty was always this little, tiny greasy hamburger that was mashed onto a hot grill. It started as the shape of a ball and then the, uh, cook would take a spatula. And, uh, first would pile, um, about three times the size of the hamburger a wad of very thinly sliced onions on top of this piece of meat and then jam in all into the grill with, uh, with a heavy spatula. After they turned it over, they then placed the bun on top and then covered the whole thing so that the steam from the hamburger steam, and, and, uh, and the grilling onions steams and flavors the buns. Uh, these things \u2014 when I was kid, I paid I think 15 cents apiece for these things, and at some places, as little as a dime. This was in the late nineteen-fifties, early nineteen-sixties. But, uh, there was something about the onions and the steam and the grease that just made this sort-of indescribably delectable little finger food. Well, they\u2019ve since become somewhat of a, uh \u2014 a, uh, chic, um, bit of, uh, high-class slumming. And the city of Birmingham being quite affluent, they have this cheesy little grill, but it\u2019s become quite the thing to, uh, to visit this place. And, well, I used to pay a dime or fifteen cents for it. Now it costs a dollar-thirty for a little grease-burger, as we used to call them, with grilled onions, a couple slices of pickle, catsup and mustard wrapped in a piece of wax paper. That\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s the, uh \u2014 that\u2019s the key to keeping the \u2014 that steamed flavor in, by the way, is this paper wrapping that they put around it."

    "unscripted_text": "Uh, I first started acting in high school, and what happened was, it was a, the musical \u201cMame,\u201d and I\u2019m not a musical person. And I \u2014 that was the first time that I ever auditioned in my life, so they asked me to read for \u2014 I think Beauregard was the character\u2019s name, the Southern gentleman. And I was so nervous I went and read with my regular voice. And so, it was the first time ever did anything like that, and meantime you learn from it. But I got in the chorus, and that was the first time. And then, uh, I had some fun with that, and people liked it, so I got a \u2026 kinda got hooked on it. And then from there I did a few more shows with, um, the high school I was at, which is Belleville, Michigan, which is outside of Detroit. It\u2019s, um, it\u2019s about seven miles from the main airport, Metropolitan Airport, and it\u2019s before you get to Ann Arbor. So, kinda stuck in the middle there. And then, uh, let\u2019s see, what else did I do? From there was, let\u2019s see, uh, plays were: \u201cDiary of Anne Frank,\u201d uh, \u201cOliver!\u201d the musical. Oh, I forget which one that was, one that was on the Titanic, but [laughs], \u201cUnsinkable Molly Brown,\u201d that\u2019s it. Uh, and from there on I went to college, which is St. Mary\u2019s College, which is in Orchard Lake, Michigan, which is, uh, by the West Bloomfield area. And the reason why I went there was not for theater because they don\u2019t have a theater program; it was decided whether I wanted to be a priest or not. So, I was raised a Catholic, and so \u2026 In my b\u2013upbringing, one of us in the family \u2014 out of the five children, one was supposed to be a priest, and one was supposed to be a nun. So, um, it was \u2014 came down to me [laughs] to be the priest. Uh, my older sister, she backed out of being a nun, so that wasn\u2019t for her. And then, when I was going to college, I kinda realized that the priesthood wasn\u2019t for me either, so I made some decisions that way. Uh, finished with a bachelor of arts in communications, and then I just thought I\u2019d try to go on to whatever kind of theater I could, which was community theater, but also work a full-time job at the same time, which was banking, or hotel work, or \u2014 haven\u2019t waited yet, so, hopefully, that\u2019ll never happen. Um, and otherwise, I\u2019ve been acting now for about \u2014 it\u2019s a little over 25 years now, yeah."

(Um) I went to Cass Tech high school downtown Detroit by the Fox Theatre. It was about 3000 students there so was kinda overwhelming at first because the building \u2014 it\u2019s a old building that was (uh) built back in the late 1800s, so it was a very old building, and it was seven floors eight if you want to count the basement where some gym classes was at. So and we only had five minutes to get from class to class so, like, I remember my freshman year I had a class on the second floor and then a class on the seventh floor so I had to hike up seven flights of stairs and get to class on time, so there wasn\u2019t much time to mingle with your friends before another class or else you\u2019ll get caught and then there\u2019s always security guards walkin\u2019 around tryin\u2019 to catch you if you\u2019re not in class on time or if you in the hallways without a pass, so, but, once I got to be a senior it started to get easier, you know I was on the football team so I was in shape so I could make it to class on time and sometimes we would just kinda wander around the hallways anyway you know we\u2019re seniors we can do that, and if the security guards come we jus \u2014 we either run from \u2018em or (uh) or we just ask \u2018em you know just let us go you know we was jus \u2014 you know, chillin\u2019 no doin\u2019 that much not causin\u2019 no problems or nothin\u2019 like that, so. And then (uh) let\u2019s see after graduation I worked at (uh) Cub Scout camp with (uh) children seven to eleven boys learnin\u2019 how to become Boy Scouts. We took \u2018em through different programs and stuff about just being in (uh) nature and everything you know their parents were there too so it wasn\u2019t like they were alone. And I was in charge of the shooting sports area which is (uh) archery and BB guns so that was kinda cool because they liked \u2014 they really doin\u2019 that so everybody always asked about me and asked when was I gonna open up the range so they can come down and shoot some more, and it was fun though because they, they got a real kick out of it and (uh) I have worked there the past two summers, actually three summers. Now I may go back now but I may get a higher position if I go back I may be program director now who is basically in charge of the whole program puts it together and I will have like a \u2014 maybe about 25 staff under me. So that\u2019s kind of exciting if I can get that. But (uh) I go to Western Michigan University, it\u2019s my third year so I\u2019m a junior it\u2019s \u2014 it went pretty fast though I still remember becomin\u2019 a freshman overwhelmed again because I was at a big school you know I have to actually walk around to class get there on my own because my mother used to drop me off to high school every day so it was kinda different but it was- it was a lot of fun because (uh) one of my best friends is here too, (uh) I grew up with him so he\u2019s still here so it\u2019s kinda \u2014 we kinda went through the trial together you know so it\u2019s better now. I played football my first year \u2014 for a year and a half at Western and then I stopped because of certain reasons I just didn\u2019t really like it that much it was fun you know but I didn\u2019t really get along too well with some of the players it\u2019s not like we were fighting or nothin\u2019 like that it\u2019s jus \u2014 we just weren\u2019t getting\u2019 along so, and I didn\u2019t get a scholarship which everybody thought that I was going to get so it was fine it wasn\u2019t that big of a deal football wasn\u2019t that, that much of an importance to me so I just concentrated on my academics and it was fun while it lasted thought I\u2019m still a huge fan I love like watchin\u2019 football I love the Detroit Lions, Michigan Wolverines. It\u2019s kinda funny because I\u2019m a Western Michigan student but I love the Michigan football team so people kinda [laughs] people kinda give me talk about that because a lot of people up here don\u2019t like Michigan football you can here \u2018em at the stadium at when they announce the Michigan score if Michigan\u2019s losing then everybody\u2019ll start cheering and under my breath I\u2019ll be upset I\u2019m all mad and stuff because they\u2019re losin\u2019 but if they say Michigan is winning everybody starts booin\u2019 and then I stand up and start clapping so it\u2019s kinda funny. We get a kick outa that me and my friend are both Michigan fans. And (um) so I stopped playin\u2019 and concentrated on my academics but it\u2019ll still fun so. Now I\u2019m just waitin\u2019 to become a senior and hopefully graduate and get a nice payin\u2019 job and start a family."

But my mom and dad met after \u2026 oh, my mom got married when she was 17 and had my sister and then ended up getting divorced a couple years later.

I ended up coming to California for college because I really like California and I wanted to study acting and I knew that would be a good place to study that especially at Cal State Fullerton and I \u2026 oh, also it was like relatively not inexpensive but within a range my family could afford, I guess. I ended up moving in, into an apartment that was kind of too far away from school. I lived with two girls that were not very nice and they \u2026 I ended up having to move out of there and I moved in, closer to school actually, like right across the street from school, which was a lot better because I didn\u2019t have a car; and I ended up living with three really good roommates, which two of them I live with now. I have so far really enjoyed California. It\u2019s really nice. I love the people. I going to school and I\u2019m happy to be here."

Uh, we lived in Brooklyn Park, uh, Brooklyn Center, Minnesota, um, for, for, until I graduated high school in 2000. And then I came back to Kansas and went to Seward County Community College in Liberal. Uh, then I came here to the University of Kansas. And I\u2019ve been here ever since. Well, I\u2019ve been surrounded by accents my whole life, um, because my grandma\u2019s from Alabama, so she has that very distinctive accent as well. And, um \u2014 but then when we moved to Minnesota, it was really weird cause people would, uh \u2014 in the grocery story, would say things like, \u201cWould you like a beg?\u201d And we were, \u201cWhat\u2019s a beg?\u201d And then we realized it was a bag. Or we would go out on the lake and on a, on a boat. And, uh, there were just others things. A lot of people up there, um, said, \u201cWould you like to come with?\u201d And that really drove my mom and dad crazy because they\u2019re like, \u201cWith whom?\u201d [Laughs] Just \u2014they\u2019re \u2014 they do say a lot of yah, for sure. And, um, and I think a lot of that now is just because it\u2019s stereotypical, so it\u2019s just been kind of formed into the mindset there. That\u2019s what people want to hear, so we say it. [Laughs] Well, Brooklyn Park is a suburb of Minneapolis on the north side and, um, there\u2019s a lot of variety of people in that area cause it is \u2014 it\u2019s right next to north Minneapolis which is very, um, urban. Um, so there\u2019s just a lot of different people. I had a lot of friends in high school of, uh, different religions and ethnicities and, um, Minneapolis has \u2014 well, Minnesota has the second-highest Hmong population, second to California. So I had a lot of, of friends who were Hmong which is on the Asian religion, um, from the Cambodian peninsula. So that was pretty cool. A lot of people aren\u2019t sure what Hmong is. And then \u2014 well, they called us Dark Center, which was just kind of a little jab at us. Uh, we were 49 percent minority and, and 51 percent white. So \u2014 which it wasn\u2019t true, but it was just funny that they called us that."

(Um) We all lived in the same house for about \u2014 till I was about 3 years old, and then \u2026 The only time I\u2019ve ever moved, actually, was (um) across the street from where I used to live. That was the one time. I wasn\u2019t even 3 \u2014 3 years old, I suppose, \u2019cause I can\u2019t really remember it (um), but\u2013 We lived in this house, and a tree ended up getting struck by lightning and crashing through the living room. So, witho\u2013 Instead of completely re-doing the living room, we decided that we would move, and, across the street, our neighbors we were good friends with had a swimming pool, and their house was a little bit nicer. And my parents thought that, (uh) instead of moving to a different neighborhood or anything like that, and fixing up the house, we\u2019d just move across the street. So, we did that and (uh) moved across the street, and (uh) I remember \u2014 I don\u2019t know if I can actually remember that actually happening though, because I was probably too young to actually remember; maybe through stories and things, but I can remember them just giving me a telephone, and having me call the movers the entire day, instead of getting me in the way, \u2019cause there was no movers, \u2019cause we just had all the neighbors bringing it across the street. But they \u2014 to get me out of the way, they sat me in the lawn with a fake phone and told me that I had to keep calling the movers \u2019cause they weren\u2019t showing up, and they were ruining the whole move, and we wouldn\u2019t get it done, and all this sort of thing. (Um) But that may just be a fable that I know, because I\u2019m not sure that I was old enough to remember it. (Um) But then we lived in that house ever since, and (um) that\u2019s where my parents still live, and hopefully someday I\u2019ll get to take over it, because I really like it. I wouldn\u2019t mind going up to live back in Minnesota again. As you travel north, I\u2019ve always discovered that, regardless of how far you go, past that \u2014 the Twin Cities there, the more north you go, it\u2019s just gonna get thicker and thicker and thicker, because I\u2019ve got some relatives up near Duluth and (uh) those places right up towards the Canadian border that\u2013 tha\u2013 their\u2013 their accents are just incredible. Just, they\u2019ve got that real thick kind of \u2014 sounding false. I have to (uh) just (mm) \u2014 to someone who\u2019s from the southern part of the state, and (uh) that Fargo, kinda from the movie, and all that kinda stuff that they heighten, and people heighten. The stereotypes are absolutely true. Like \u2014 and \u2014 for the most, I\u2019ve seen more of it to the west side than I have from the east, \u2019cause I have relatives that live in Wisconsin, northern Wisconsin, as well as \u2014 I guess that would be Michigan\u2013 North Dakota, and I\u2019ve found it to be much, much thicker on the west side, where it\u2019s closer to South Dakota and North Dakota. And that\u2019s where I get all the \u201cOh, yah, yo, yah, you betcha, you know, the hot dish,\u201d and all that sort of stuff. It seems to be a lot more prevalent over there than it does on the east side. [Subject reads from \u201cComma Gets a Cure\u201d in dialect, through \u201ctower.\u201d] Now, I guess I\u2019m not sure if those \u2014 I don\u2019t know if can do it very well, but those \u2014 those \u201cold\u201d and the \u201cboat\u201d and all those sounds are just \u2014 are the really thick ones that I\u2019ve always (um) tear \u2014 It feels like it\u2019s smiley talk, is what I\u2019ve\u2013 Like, I\u2019ve \u2014 someone once described it to me as smiley talk, because it was so\u2026 (Um) Because, I guess the community up there; I don\u2019t know. Everyone\u2019s smiling all the time. Either that or killing each other because of the cold, so \u2026 It\u2019s \u2014 there\u2019s that \u2014 It feels kinda like \u2014 Saying those Os and stuff like that kind of puts a smile on your face, and I think that \u2014 I know that always helps me do the false voice a little bit easier, by keeping the [in dialect] \u201cworking daily at the old zoo.\u201d Or I guess that\u2019s \u2014 I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s it, but (um) that\u2019s just kind of how I\u2019ve always thought about it."

Uhhh, I now live in Oxford, Mississippi. The reason for that is varied; I taught thirty-one years in, uh, Memphis city schools, I went to high school in Memphis and went to college here in Old Miss, fell in love with it; it\u2019s God\u2019s school. Uh, anyway I taught thirty-one years in, in the Memphis city schools and retired from there, and I when I heard an opening was here and got the opening and taught five years regular here and, uh, two years part-time here, so I\u2019ve retired three times from teaching. I just retired from the last two years. First of all, Memphis has a barbecue contest, Memphis in May, and uh, I was on a team and we won the contest in \u201880 and \u201881. But first of all, Southern barbecue is always pork. Uh, secondly, the main thing is not the sauce, ever. Uh, most people think once you put barbecue sauce on something, you know from outside of this area that makes it barbecue. No, no, indeed it\u2019s the cooking, and the cooking is long and painstaking. For instance, we cooked a whole hog. This takes fourteen hours. Uh, you baste it some as you go with \u2014 put a dry baste on it then, uh, vinegar and water to keep it from catching on fire. Uh, anyway, this, this is what we basically won the contest with, but it, its time-consuming. We b\u2019\u2013turn the whole hog one time, and one only. Uh, but, the it, most people out there their idea of barbecue is, you know heat something up and slap a little barbecue sauce on it or another idea is when you grill something outside. Well, grilling outside on a, on a common little grill is not barbecue; that\u2019s done in fifteen, twenty minutes and, and barbecue is a very thorough, very slow cooking, the temperature; uh, doesn\u2019t get up above about a hundred-and-sixty degrees within the meat when I\u2019m barbecue-in. Uh, within the middle of the meat, and its, it\u2019s the slowness of it that does it."

At age 26, I purchased a two-family home in Belleville, which is a suburb of Newark with about 35,000 residents. From any point in Belleville, one can clearly view the Manhattan skyline. We are only five miles west of lower Manhattan. Before 9-11, we used to be able to see the twin towers in detail from the hill up the street from my house. The twin towers and I have some history. Like many people from this area also did, I spent a lot of my youth over in Manhattan. I can remember sitting at the base of the towers countless times. My friends and I would take the PATH train over to the city, which is Manhattan \u2014 get some pizza, or whatever, and go relax at the bottom of the towers. No matter how many times you stared at those towers, they were still just as amazing. Years later, I proposed to my beautiful wife Demaris on the top of tower number 2. Tower number 1 was reserved for TV antennas, and the public wasn\u2019t allowed up there. Less than three years after I proposed to her, the towers were gone. On 9-11, 2001, I was still sleeping, when my mother, who lives in Pennsylvania, calls me to tell me that the World Trade Center had been attacked. I threw on some clothes and drove over to a clearing in Kearny, the town right next door to us. There, with about a hundred other people, most of us with video cameras. I watched the collapse of the second tower. The feeling was surreal, as we all stood there, watching the spectacle with our naked eye. Our cars were parked on the side of the road, each radio blaring with the news of what was happening. I felt like I was in a bad fifties sci-fi movie. It\u2019s hard to believe that those towers are actually gone. Anyway, you are now listening to an authentic northern New Jersey accent; 44 years in the making and not to be confused with the more common New York City accent. Yes, we do say \u201cwalkie-talkie, water, coffee, long, you\u2019se guys, radiator,\u201d et cetera. When you go to a supermarket here, you don\u2019t get a shopping cart, you get a \u201ccarriage,\u201d and you are never standing in line, you are standing \u201con line.\u201d \u201cG\u2019ead\u201d means go ahead. For instance, \u201cG\u2019ead and get a carriage. I need get some coffee and water, then I need ta talk to the manager for a while. So you\u2019se guys, g\u2019ead without me.\u201d Lots and lots of unique things about the way we speak in this area. Uh, time\u2019s up, gotta run. Thanks for listening."

    "unscripted_text": "All right (um). I guess my family is far from what you\u2019d call mainstream. I mean, my parents got divorced when I was three, and I lived with my mom. My parents got divorced when I was about 3, and (um) my dad moved away, and I lived with my mom (uh) most of my life. And she (uh) \u2014 her family is Jewish, and so most of my (uh) holiday experience have been of the Jewish sort, but my uncle, my mother\u2019s brother, married (uh) a Sicilian woman. And so I always had the Christmas thing going on too. But, one of the most unique things about my family is that (um) every Christmas Eve, my grandparents, and my mother and I, and some friends of our family who is also Jewish \u2026 We\u2019d all go to Atlantic City, to spend Christmas Eve in Atlantic City. And, you wouldn\u2019t believe it, but there are a lot of people in Atlantic City on Christmas Eve, but they\u2019re all Jewish or Asian. (Uh) And being the kind of young child that I was back then, I had nothing to do in Atlantic City, because it was all gambling, so I\u2019d really be bored there. And I\u2019d find all kinds of interesting things to do. And then the next day, we\u2019d drive back down the New Jersey Turnpike into Staten Island, where my uncle and his wife and their two kids lived. My two cousins. And we would have the traditional Italian Christmas. With half of the people there being Brooklyn Jews, and the other half being New Jersey Italian people. So, there\u2019s a lot of good stories in that respect. Well, Italian people spend a lot of time at the table after the meal. And there\u2019s a lot of talking and yelling and screaming. And (uh) a lot of Italian people, they, they drink espresso, and they put this liqueur in the espresso. It\u2019s called Sambuca. And my mother is quite fond of this, this little after-dinner drink. So (um) on several occasions she\u2019d have a little too much of this, and there\u2019d be arguments in which my mother would start yelling at certain people, and everyone would just laugh it off. But I would feel like a putz. For sitting there, next to my mother, who\u2019s obviously drunk off her bean, and screaming at the rest of the family. (Um) Let\u2019s see. What else? My cousins. I have two cousins who are (uh) \u2014 who are a hybrid of that Jewish Italian thing, but they were raised Catholic. (Um) My first experience of Catholicism was going to my cousin\u2019s first Communion. You know they have to wear the white suits and everything. I\u2019ve taken pictures of them. It was lots of fun, until his nose started bleeding all over the white suit and (uh) \u2014 yeah, that was pretty scary. But (uh) he was a really nice kid, very bright. (Uh) His mother puts a lot of pressure on him, \u2019cause she wants him to be a doctor. And I don\u2019t understand that myself, but she puts\u2013 I mean, he\u2019s such a nice kid. (Uh) My other cousin is a girl, and she\u2019s just a brat. They give her everything she wants, and she\u2019s going to grow up to be one of those girls: (falsetto, muffled) \u201cMy boyfriend, Anthony, won\u2019t take me to the mall, Ma. I need to go to the mall. I need to go.\u201d So, you know, you live in Staten Island, all you do is go to the mall. It\u2019s either the mall or the dump. That\u2019s all there really is in Staten Island. Couple of\u2026 middle income houses, I don\u2019t know. (Uh) Growing up in the part of Brooklyn I\u2013 I did, (um) I didn\u2019t really have many friends, who lived around where I did, because I went to school so far from where I actually lived. But (um) a lot of my friends were from Brooklyn, but from different parts, and (um) we would spend a lot of time (uh) hanging out together on the weekends, because we went to dance class together. And (uh) I would say it was during that period in my life that I spent a good four hours a weekend on the subway. And the subway is a very interesting place, because so many different kinds of people are thrust into an environment that nobody feels comfortable in. And y\u2013 you kind of have some kind of camaraderie, when, you know, when the train just stops in the middle of the track, and you know, you have 15 minutes of delays when you\u2019re sitting there in pitch black, sitting next to someone who smells like something you-have-no-idea\u2026 But (uh), yeah, we would get into a lot of trouble, because we were loud and rowdy on the trains and we\u2013 we had our dance classes near Lincoln Center. And (uh) they\u2019re a pretty \u2014 bunch of straight people that get on the train at Lincoln Center, you know. And we\u2019d go out to Brooklyn. So we\u2019d make a lot of noise, and people would clear out the car usually, and it was \u2014 it was pretty rough. \u2026"

Now I realize that most of you who will listen to this tape will have no idea what the Polo Grounds were. The Polo Grounds were a field, an athletic field, a professional-athletic field where the New York football Giants and the New York baseball Giants played. Living between these two stadiums was fabulous because that meant that any day that I didn\u2019t feel like going to school, which amounted to many days, especially during the football and baseball seasons, I had a choice of either going to watch the Yankees Baseball team, the Yankees Football team, the Giants Baseball team or the Giants Football team, in person. Now back in those days, I know you won\u2019t believe this, but back in those days, you could actually go to the ball park about the sixth inning and the turnstiles would be left unattended. So that means that you could get up to the general admission turnstiles; there would be nobody there to watch; you could sneak under, over or around these turnstiles, get into the ball park and watch the last three or four innings of most every game."

    "unscripted_text": "I was born a long time ago, and we, as kids, did not have what the kids have today. We had no video recorders. We had no \u2014 certainly no computers, certainly no Play Stations, Ataris, or anything like that. We didn\u2019t even have remote-control cars or robots. So, most of our days were spent on the streets. And on the streets, we had to make up a variety of different games to play. Some games included just what we called \u2014 what you people in Chicago called as a pinkball; we people in New York called as a spaldeen [sp?], which was a simple game of punchball. Other games required that that same ball, but various \u2014 but of two various size of sticks. One game you would only need two or three people, a pitcher and a catcher against another team of the same size, and you would \u2014 you would would pitch fast to the batter, and he would try to obviously hit it, and the different distances meant whether it was a single, double or triple. Other forms of stickball, we has played actually on the street. Where you would have \u2014 the length of a single, double or triple would be measured by the various sewers that were on the street. A third form of stickball was called \u201cOff the Wall.\u201d In that game, you would throw the yellow \u2014 the pinkball, as you call it here, or a spalldeen, off the wall and the batter had to hit it either on the fly, off the wall or on one bounce. That takes care of the basic stickball games. Then we go on to what we would call a nice little game of football. But there again we had to play on the street. So, a typical play would be tell someone to go down, and I get behind the yellow Chevy, and you throw the ball to him that way \u2014 the football that way. It was not a game where we had any width, because the streets were narrow. And we\u2019d use the cars as blocker. Now, if you had absolutely no equipment with you, you could play a game called \u201cJohnny on a Pony.\u201d This game gets a little rough. You would have one team, s- where one person would stand flat up against the wall. And the various other members of this team would crouch down in front of him. The opposite team would run, and jump on that team that is bent over, and try to break them apart. Now, you could jump any way that you like. You could land wit\u2019 your knees, your elbows, and anything. The team that is crouching had to hold the other entire team on for approximately ten seconds. So that was a game like that. Now, getting back to the spalldeen type of game, if you only had a spalldeen and no sitck, you could play various games. You could play stoopball, which you would \u2014 you would, uh, stand in front of, uh, a set of stairs in front of a building. And you would throw the ball against the stoop. And again, depending on how far that ball went, again would depend on whether you got a single, double, or triple as well. The la \u2014 another game would be curbball. There you would lay in an intersection, where each corner of the intersection; one would be first base, second base, and third base. And you would do \u2014 and you would play that game as such."

    "unscripted_text": "I was born in Brooklyn, New York. Um, didn\u2019t live very long in Brooklyn, left after probably my fifth birthday, and then we went out to Queens, where I started my education in Rosedale, Queens. Went to school there till I was about in the ninth grade, and then made the migration to Long Island, to get away from the inner city. But anyway, I\u2019ve lived my whole life in New York. I work in the city. I\u2019ve always worked in New York. Um, my profession kind of leads me to wo-; school was fun. I liked school. I liked going to college particularly. I think I finally got to a place where I could actually say I was learning something and not just repeating things that were told to me. And I enjoyed that immensely, and I had the opportunity to travel abroad for one year, which was very good. And I went to France and studied there. And being of an Italian background, being in the south of France was like being home, and that was my first time to go to Italy, also. Which was a real eye-opener, because what I thought was Italian, I soon found out was really Italian-American and had nothing to do with Italy. When I graduated from university, I went back to live in Florence, which was the best year I probably have had thus far. And, in that it was the culmination of so many years of study and seeing art in books, and seeing places in books, and reading about historical events, and then actually having the good fortune to be walking on the streets where Dante walked or where Michelangelo walked, it was quite an experience, and one that I will always remember. So, let me share with you a little Christmas Eve memory I have. Um, hen we lived in Rosedale, my \u2014 we lived in a very small house, and my mother would prepare a traditional Italian meal. And a traditional Italian meal was: anything that swam got cooked. So you would have about fifteen different kinds of dead fish on the table, looking up at you, some of them with their heads intact. And of course we would devour them, because we were just, you know, Italian, and that\u2019s what we did. But one year stands out in my mind because my father\u2019s brother, Jimmy \u2014 which is a very odd name to have if you\u2019re an Italian to begin with (James is not exactly ringing true to any Italian) but \u2014 he came over with his family, and my mother made one of her traditional meals, and I was, you know, helping her. My mother only had two sons, so of course the older one got to be the kitchen steward, and that\u2019s what I did. The kitchen was all of two feet away from where the table was, so, as I said, it was a small house. But my uncle was sitting at the head of the table, which would be the place of honor, in his white shirt, which he always wore and never took off, and he had the little pen pocket protector with his pens in it, and, you know, crew-cut, and glasses. Kind of like a Barry Goldwater guy. He\u2019s sitting at the head of the table, and my mother\u2019s dishing out the linguine, which is dry and then she\u2019s gonna top it with this amazing sauce that has every kind of: squid and clams and mussels and lobster and every kind of shellfish imaginable, things that I don\u2019t even remember eating. But anyway, I was offering him the dish and, as I was offering him the dish, the dish stopped, but the pasta became airborne and it just slid out of the dish because it had been liquefied by the sauce, and it just went flying all over him, completely; his head, his glasses, and his pen pocket protector, which now became a receptacle for squid, and clams dangling out of the edge of it. And of course, I looked up and thought that I was going to be struck by lightning, but the lightning turned out to be my father, who gave me two quick noogies on the top of my head, and I collapsed under the dining room table, looking up and realizing that I had indeed been hit and I was down for the count. But, let me tell you what, that was my best Christmas Eve because I got to slap uncle Jimmy right across the face with the pasta. And that was the best ever. \u2026"

    "unscripted_text": "Yeah, the building was my neighborhood. For example, you know how people here say, \u201cOh, yeah, your kid\u2019s growin\u2019 up an\u2019 everything. Oh, he\u2019s so much bigger than when I saw him the las\u2019 time\u2026\u201d Or whatever. All that in my \u2014 in me growing up happened in my building. So, I had the neighbors who lived in 915, when I lived on 14, and they were the ones I\u2019d see going up in the elevator. And it was in the elevator where you saw everybody. And I think that\u2019s one of the biggest differences when I \u2014 when I talk with people who grew up in a small town, or whatever. I\u2019m used to seeing strangers all the time. Um, and so whenever I\u2019ve gone to a little town, where everybody knows everybody, knows everybody, it\u2019s a trip because that\u2019s not how I grew up. I was \u2014 I always grew up used to seeing people. And I remember the first time that I went to see Minneapolis, I was on a, uh, school trip from college, from this little rural town where I lived in, and we were coming up to the big city for something. And I looked in, and I saw these big beautiful buildings on a Saturday, but there was nobody. There wasn\u2019t anybody anywhere, and I was like, who stuck in a vacuum cleaner and sucked out all the people? And now it makes sense, because it means that, you know, we were probably driving through downtown Minneapolis, which can be pretty empty on the weekend because nobody\u2019s working. So, it\u2019s a funny thing about the way I know I say my A\u2019s. I used to live on Harriet Avenue, 2400 Harriet, and, uh, I remember being on the bus, the number 2 bus, running along Franklin Avenue. Everybody had gotten off the bus except for me. It\u2019s about to reach its last end point. But it\u2019s dark, and it\u2019s kinda hard to see the streets, so I called out to the bus driver, \u201cCould you please stop at Harriet Avenue?\u201d And he was like, \u201cWhat?\u201d And I said, \u201cCould you please stop at Harriet?\u201d And he\u2019s like, \u201cWhat?\u201d \u201cCould you please stop at Harriet?\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d And then I remembered. I had this accent, so I said, \u201cCould you stop at Harriet?\u201d And he said, \u201cOh, sure.\u201d And the bus stopped. I have made a carrot and apple salad that I actually learned how to make in Russia. And you take your carrot and you chop it up, and then you, uh, and you take your apple and you chop it up. And usually I use lemon juice in there, but, you know, you could be inspired to use orange juice, but I, I wouldn\u2019t use, you know, I probably wouldn\u2019t use apple juice. I think, well, maybe the apple juice would work, but if I put Coca-Cola in there \u2014 some Coke \u2014 it\u2019d be horrible. But I wouldn\u2019t put \u201cpop\u201d in there, \u2018cause we don\u2019t drink \u201cpop\u201d in New York City. We drink soda. Here\u2019s another thing: We wear sneakers. We don\u2019t wear tennys or running shoes, and I\u2019ve confused the kids in my daycare. I\u2019m like, \u201cPlease put your sneakers back on,\u201d and they look at me like, huh? \u201cPut your sneakers back on.\u201d And they\u2019re like, \u201cWhat?\u201d And they don\u2019t know what I\u2019m saying when I say sneakers. And that\u2019s what I grew up calling them. They call them \u201crunning shoes\u201d or \u201ctennys.\u201d They\u2019re sneakers. \u2026"

Ahh, which also says that, I guess, if you\u2019re listening to my accent, I don\u2019t have much of the sort of Jewish Long Island thing, having spent all my time around Catholics. So I really wasn\u2019t exposed to that dialect. And when I went to, uh, college, I went to the University of Virginia and it always used to drive crazy because people would meet me and, y\u2019know, of course they\u2019d say, \u201cYou\u2019re a Yankee; where ya from?\u201d I\u2019d say, you know, \u201cNew York,\u201d they\u2019d say, \u201cWhere?\u201d ahh, and I\u2019d say, \u201cLong Island.\u201d And they would say, \u201cOh, Long-Gyland?\u201d And I would look at them and I would think, why are they doing \u2014 and everybody would do that: \u201cOh, Long-Gyland?\u201d And I didn\u2019t get the joke. I really didn\u2019t get the joke. Because nobody I had ever met on Long Island had ever said, \u201cLong-Gyland.\u201d And then I joined a Jewish fraternity actually, in Virginia, and uh, over time began to realize where on Long Island we were talking about that accent coming from. I went down there; uhh, my roommate was a guy that I knew from Long Island who also went to Chaminade with me, and his name was F-O-S-T-E-R. And, uh, it was always Paul and Foster. Uhh, \u201cHey Foster, good to see ya man. [unclear] Foster let\u2019s do this,\u201d and Paul. And I came back, I think, from Virginia after three years saying, \u201cPaul and Foster.\u201d And, so people would hear \u2014 hear me, y\u2019know, say, \u201cFoster\u201d or \u201cPaul,\u201d and they\u2019d go, \u201cPfft, where you from?\u201d So that\u2019s when I first began to realize that my accent was mellowing a little bit. And then I would listen to my sister, my older sister, who was born and raised and still lives on Long Island. She\u2019s got this kinda heavy, Long Island sort of a sing-songy, y\u2019know, this kind of thing going on when she talks to you on the phone \u2014\u201cI was talking to mom the other day, and, oh Paul, you should see beh bleh bleh\u2026\u201d And I\u2019m like, I am not related to this person, am I? My dad was born in the States, raised in Portugal by an aunt and a grandmother and then returned to the States at about 14 or 15. So he had, throughout his life, an accent. Uhh, when I was four he took us to Portugal for like, four months and even as a 4-year-old, now I remember, uh, the place and the time because it was so different. We went over on a ship. We loaded up the Oldsmobile on the ship. You crossed the ocean and then went and lived in this town where the Oldsmobile was the only car; it was all ox carts \u2014 ox-drawn carts, dirt roads, uh, no running water, no electricity. We brought Coleman lamps and heaters. And we had the animal bins beneath the house. And the bathroom, I remember, basically was, y\u2019know, this room with side-by-side holes cut in these, uh, plank seats. So, but then when we returned I almost never spoke another word of it [the Portuguese language] because my father, I think, was very conscious of the immigrant thing."

They are in their 70s. My mom worked in the same Caribbean community in which she lived. All of her friends and colleagues have been Caribbean people, whether from Grenada or elsewhere. My dad\u2019s friends have primarily been Caribbean people, mainly Grenadians, but he worked in Manhattan, where most of his colleagues were not Caribbean people. So I grew up hearing Caribbean dialect; some of the children I spoke with, played with, spoke AAVE, since there were many African-American kids in the neighborhood. When I was 14, I went to high school in a different section of Brooklyn, populated primarily by white ethnic New Yorkers, those who spoke in the New York dialect and had the stereotypical \u201cNew York accent.\u201d I also went to college and graduate school in NYC, but in Manhattan, again, surrounded by Caribbean speakers, speakers of AAVE and white ethnics, but there were also people of other groups \u2014 more Asians, Latinos and people from other parts of the city, state, country and world. As I think of it now, all the schools I attended, my teachers and professors seemed to be speakers of some form of what I understand to be General American. If anything, it was what I was taught, although I heard different dialects outside the classroom. When I was 28, I moved to Charlottesville, Virginia, and lived there for seven years. I got more exposure to the SAE dialect spoken by blacks and the whites who lived there. I then spent a year in Ithaca New York, then five years in western Massachusetts. I have lived in the Boston area since last year, and I\u2019m becoming more familiar with the Boston accent. It does bother me when people hear I\u2019m from New York and presume I should have a New York accent. In their minds, I should sound like Fran Drescher. I\u2019m sure there are intonations to my speech that are typical of New Yorkers, but I don\u2019t pronounce all my words exactly like how some New Yorkers do. I don\u2019t say \u201ccawfee\u201d or ask for \u201cshuggas.\u201d So I\u2019ll express some phrases I have heard my relatives say in Grenadian dialect. My mom is telling me about their doctor\u2019s appointment this week: Yu daddy an me we goin doctor Wednesday. Ah go call yu an tell yu how we make out. She is admonishing me that I should call my aunt: Yu ain\u2019 call yu tantie an them? Dad is joking with me in slang; he means to say, count me out, I\u2019m not in this: Ah ain\u2019 dey in yu business! So I would say that those are some phrases that indicate what I remember hearing from my relatives, my parents, with respect to Grenadian dialect, and I hope this has been helpful for you, and I have really been glad to have the chance to participate in this program. Thank you much."

And I\u2019m really flattered, you know, and at that time I didn\u2019t even realize what flattery was, but, um, that my art teacher thought of me, you know. And that\u2019s when I became passionate about the museum and everything it does. Oh, El Museo del Barrio sponsors the Three Kings Day Parade, which to my mother \u2014 my mother\u2019s name is Reyes and she was born on Three Kings Day \u2014 and she always even as a child, um, celebrated that, you know, holiday with us, even if it was just putting \u2026 You know, we didn\u2019t have a lot of money, so even if it was just putting a little, you know, uh, some pieces of candy and just for them to have that parade gave it more meaning to me. I love, um, living, you know, having been raised in this community from 5, and I still live in this community; it means a lot of, a lot to me to be able to work with the people that I grew up, you could say grew up around the culture, the music, the foods because the dynamics of East Harlem is changing. When I moved here, it was a lot of blacks and Hispanics, primarily Puerto Rican, but now we have Mexicans in the area, Dominicans \u2014 we also have white people moving back, which is great because the neighborhood is getting better. I hate to say it but, um, they start cleaning it more, you know, more sanitation comes around a little bit more for the housing for the housing prices that\u2019s not too good because the apartments get more expensive, but, um, we get better restaurants, it\u2019s safer. You start seeing the police more; it\u2019s no longer to harass the residents but more to keep us safe again. And then El Museo is becoming so much more popular, not only because we renovated it, you know, but also, um, again the activities that we offer, and now it\u2019s including \u2026 it\u2019s not when it was founded it was Puerto Rican, they wanted to expose Puerto Rican art, but now we have so many other Latino cultures that we represent, and it\u2019s like a beautiful thing to get all these people together. I\u2019ve learned so much in working here these last two years."

Worked over here \u2018fore after I started workin\u2019 and drove back and forth, and then I moved over here at age 28, and I been here ever since. Down in Hyde county Englehard it\u2019s real slow, laid-back, you know, country, and over here it\u2019s wide open you know and \u2026 Be involved of [unclear] uh, old high school, so we had to remodel the front part of it and redo it. And then the back part was so close to the ground we dug out underneath of it so we\u2019d have clearance underneath and remodeled it back to a historical state. All original, no trim- you know, you know the corners and everything so put her back to original. I had it a, uh, milled in Currituck right across the bridge in Currituck County. The guy has a mill there; he milled it all for me. Window trim, floor trim, the whole works, it\u2019s all from Currituck. Like we got on our own island cause they sell those trees and all you know. Down there on the, uh, Corolla light \u2026 down there you know, no Currituck light it is, instead of Corolla, it\u2019s Currituck light, they sell. Done a bunch a\u2019 that and done the Roanoke Island Inn for John Wilson and all a his stuff that he\u2019s been doing for the last, so many years I do it all for him. He\u2019s my main employer, you know he, he keeps me employed the most of it. At the Currituck light, the old part of the building, the, the old keeper\u2019s house cause it was it was felled down, and we went back in the back and find old hand rails and everything. It was the, like the keeper\u2019s house at the lighthouse, at the at the Currituck lighthouse, which now has a gift shop run by the, uh, Eddie Green, and it\u2019s a Christmas shop but it\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s neat inside. And this one here this has been a real probably about the best job I ever had as far as I, uh \u2013 using the original wood you know, matching the real wood all the way through it. \u2018Cause a lot of times they come in and put sheet rock and he\u2019s done wood all the way. With the Outer Banks like you say, the islan(d) you know, the as far as people comin\u2019 out here you can go fishing any time you want to just bout and catch fish in the sound or the ocean, either one. In the ocean you catch tuna and dolphin and all that; you can\u2019t catch them in the sound; you catch croakers and trout and flounder and stuff like that in the sound. You got all these local lakes that you can bass fish is all freshwater; you got bass and crappie and catfish and all that stuff you can catch, you know, so you got a mixture by your own island itself. But in the sound, when the other side of the island the Pamlico Sound part of it, that\u2019s when it gets deep. But yeah, that, that little place in there you go through is shallow. Well you got Wanchese and Manns Harbor and, uh, Colington Harbor \u2013 is, uh, like a little island parts you know. All I know they come in on a boat you know caught a boat down to Englehard here or a place called Nebraska [unclear] that\u2019s where a lot of old boats used to, used to be like a harbor that there they come into, and that\u2019s where they started from right there, coming there \u2026"

And, um, they, when we had any kind of activity at night, they would have to spend the night with somebody over here in order to go. It\u2019s that English accent. Uh, my father was in the University of Virginia, and the woman that was in the, um, head nurse, she said, \u201cYou talk so near like they do from there.\u201d And, but I\u2019m, I want to keep it. I don\u2019t know because I\u2019ve never been to England, um, but I would like to go sometime. My husband\u2019s people, they have their coat of arms. They\u2019re strictly, um, English. His mother was a Stowe, and his, um, father was a Peele now well that, I don\u2019t think, I don\u2019t know whether that was English or not, but his, his mother\u2019s people came from England. And I was a Russell, and my grandmother was a Journagan [spelling?], and there was a Lord Journagan a few years ago in England. So I mean, I know we\u2019re all kinda, English you know, our ancestors. My little grandson was sitting here one night and a commercial came on TV and it was the pig man over on the beach and he said, \u201cYou got to stop and get some barbecue,\u201d and Lyle said, \u201cWho ever heard of barbecue?\u201d said, \u201cIt\u2019s barbecue.\u201d So I mean, it just, we\u2019re all, you know, talk alike. Now in Ocracoke, they talk real fast. You have to really listen. And Rudolph is from Hatteras, but he lost a lot of his because he was in service and he traveled a lot. And when we go anywhere, people say, \u201cOh, I know where you\u2019re from!\u201d I\u2019m the one that gets blamed, and he\u2019s from further that way than I am. But I went to school, now, the children from Wanchese have a real heavy brogue just like, what, as bad as me or worse, but see I went to school with \u2018em. And, uh, I have a girlfriend that lives in Greensboro, and she\u2019s lived there for years, and she still has it, so you don\u2019t get rid of it. My son that\u2019s, he does that every year, he has, um, crab pots, or they\u2019re, er, they\u2019re peeler pots, and he catches \u2019em and brings them in and he has to sort them. The green ones are not; he has to put them in different sheds and as they ripen; the come out of their sheds. And that\u2019s what we have: soft-shelled crabs. Well, now my husband was a party fisherman. My son-in-law is a sculptor. He lives in Florida, and he made that boat and give it to Rudolph one Christmas that was his boat. And, uh, he caught marlin and sailfish and all kinds of stuff like that. Now my little grandson, or he\u2019s not little, he has been catchin\u2019 some beautiful trout and stuff in the, um, sound. He has nets that he\u2019s been catching. And, um, he just living up here, and my son\u2019s home\u2019s right next door to me. But now my son also hard crabs, but, um, now there\u2019s another run of peelers it\u2019s gonna come. This years been the worst peeler season that they\u2019ve had, and so then we\u2019re hoping that the next run, there\u2019s usually two runs that we\u2019re hoping it will be better, but, um, we have possums and raccoons and stuff like that, but we don\u2019t have any deer. No, but I\u2019ll tell you what, when my son was just a little feller I looked out and all I could think about, oh me! I saw all these things in this little creek, and it was porpoises, and all I could think about was sharks, and I screamed for him; I thought he was, you know, right that minute, you don\u2019t think you just think, \u201cMy child\u2019s out there.\u201d And it was porpoises. There was about five of \u2018em. That was the worst sight. It scared me until I found out what they were."

I was born in Heidelberg, Germany, right by the castle, and, uh, Heidelberg\u2019s a real famous little city. You know, it \u2014 university there. It\u2019s \u2014 I think it\u2019s \u2014 Heidelberg\u2019s rated in, like, the top two or three universities in the world. And, uh, it\u2019s got, y\u2019know, rich stuff there. It\u2019s, uh, kind of like a hamlet, uh, hamlet-ish type town that\u2019s tried to maintain that, uh, uh, quaintness. \u2019S a big castle that goes back to the, uh, um, y\u2019know, feudal, medieval times. Um, Kant, eh, used to walk there, uh, and study there. Uh, they\u2019ve had some distinguishables that sat in the, uh, philosophy chair there at, uh \u2026 And, uh, I think Kant was one of \u2019em. Like I say, there\u2019s a place there, it\u2019s known as Kant\u2019s walk, because, uh, he walked the same time \u2013 People could set their watch by where Kant was in his morning walk. He was so methodical. An\u2019, uh, the Allies as I, uh \u2014 I think I\u2019ve mentioned it \u2014 the Allies didn\u2019t bomb Heidelberg. It\u2019s one of the only places they didn\u2019t bomb. Uh, an\u2019 a lot had to do with so many of the pilots went to school there, an\u2019 had such fond memories of, of Heidelberg. An\u2019 of course, the Heidelberg scar, y\u2019know, comes from, from there. That was a little scar that you, uh, if you got it, y\u2019know, you were proud of it. You took a little saber to the cheek, and, uh, it\u2019s a famous dueling sp\u2013 scar now. I, I think I prob\u2019ly knew at one time exactly why, why didn\u2019t they call it the Munich scar, or, y\u2019know, something? Now, there\u2019s a reason why, but, y\u2019know I\u2019ll have to look in my book an\u2019 refresh my, uh, memories on that. But Heidelberg is a, uh, in Europe is a very well-known town. Um, 1949 came, uh, to United States an\u2019 went to Boston, came in at Boston, an\u2019 then we had family here in Cleveland, so we moved to Cleveland. And at that time, we moved to around the West 25th/Vega area, which, um, would at that time, probably have, y\u2019know, a lot of immigrant-type people."

There\u2019s I had, uh, I had quite a few friends. I was pretty, pretty shy back then. But it\u2019s, uh, it\u2019s kind of a big spread out town, and there was quite a bit to do around there. Um, I kind of just kept to myself though, actually. I, I read a lot. I re read a ton of comic books back then, and I \u2026 back then I was more into visual arts, and I would do a lot of drawing and sketching and some painting too, and every once in a great while I would drive arou-around with my friends. But but mostly, that\u2019s kinda bored me, and then I realized they were gonna go try to get beer and liquor and stuff, and I really wasn\u2019t into that junk, so I kind of just did my own thing. So, but I had I I have to say I\u2019ve I\u2019ve had a a good life growing up. I mean, all together \u2014 a really good life. I\u2019ve had great parents they, they spoiled me pretty much when I was young. But I mean they definitely taught me the right and wrong about everything, too. And so, yeah its it growing up there was pretty fun. After, after that I moved around some and of course I live in western, southwesternish Oklahoma now. And, the town I came from, that I was in for the last four years, Elk City, that\u2019s quite a small town and there\u2019s quite a bit of a difference living there as opposed to Bartlesville. There\u2019s not much to do, ah \u2026 I, I don\u2019t think in Elk City. Again, I\u2019m I\u2019m still not really a person who has to re- rely on a lot of stuff out there to do. But, it\u2019s it\u2019s kind of a quiet little town."

So it\u2019s, uh, going back home for me is kind of like going back into my childhood. So I had a lot of good childhood memories playing sports, playing with friends, things like that. I love to travel, and from one job to the other I kept kind of increasing my salary and, uh, adding more things to, uh, my resume. And I finally found a job that fit me perfectly which was in sales. And it required me to leave the state and, uh, eventually move to, uh, some of the southern cities. I was transferred around, and I\u2019ve been moved all over the US many many times just because of my positions in sales and sales management. I was working sales from the age of 26 with, uh, selling hospital disposable products. I did that for a number of years and I segued into a pharmaceutical nutritional company called Me Johnson\u2019s selling infant formula for a number of years, and then was hired by Nutrisher, which is a Dutch company, that made an entrance into the US, and I was the national sales manager for the infant formula company, which gave me a lot of nutritional background. And from there I segwayed into selling nutritional ingredients. And I was with Acatris for five years, and then Frutarom purchased Acatris and, uh, acquired all the people that were with Acatris, so I ended up with Frutarom, and I\u2019ve been with them now for two years. We went next door. I guess we just didn\u2019t know about it because we all met because we all um, who\u2019s Joseph, Cherie, myself, and Laron and Cantee, and we met there and we said, \u201cWhere do we want to eat?\u201d Well, we didn\u2019t know any place in the in Treasure Island, so we went next door to the, umm, the Mirage and ate Chinese food. Oh, and it was a real Chinese restaurant. Of course with Cantee being Chinese, he went to order for us and Laron, Laron had had Chinese food like that before. They ordered uh jelly fish and several things that were like \u2026 looked like spaghetti but, it was real good, and, uh, they had duck. They brought the whole duck out, head and all. It had been roasted and, uh, we just had \u2026 it was excellent food but some of it I didn\u2019t care for. I had, uh, beef with, beef with stir-fried noodles but their, uh, stir-fried rice, I mean their, uh, fried rice was delicious. It was made from scratch. It was very very good."

It\u2019s funny, because she was born a day after me, but she\u2019s three years younger than I am. But anyway, so we moved around almost every year. I lived generally in the Metropolitan Area of Portland; St. John\u2019s, Gresham, Troutdale, and those general areas. And I\u2019m sure that there\u2019s probably more, but I can\u2019t really remember them very well. When I was 10 years old, my parents moved us up \u2014 me and my sister \u2014 up to southwest Washington, just across the river, so I could still go and see my grandma, if I wanted to. And I grew up there until I was 21 years old. I graduated from high school; it was the first I was able to graduate from school for four years. A little late, but who cares, right? As far as moving around is concerned. So, I didn\u2019t have a whole lot of friends; I was kind of a loner. But I really, really loved choir music, and I was in choir for five years. When I turned 21, I moved cross-country with a friend of mine to Baltimore, Maryland, where I lived for about two or three nights. After that, we moved down to the D.C. metropolitan area, where I am currently living. I was a receptionist. Which was really very interesting. You get to hear a lot of different types of people, all over the country because the product that, from the company that I was working for, the product was very well-known on the East Coast. But I had never really even heard of it until I moved here. But people who grew up in the baby-boomer era were very familiar. And even though they moved away, to all kinds of places, they would still \u2014 they had interest in getting the product. So I got to do a lot of over-the-phone sales, and it was a kind of a game, a fun thing for me to do, to try and locate where each person was from originally because of the way they sounded. And I was, I got pretty good at it, actually. Being able to tell if somebody was from New York or Jersey, or of they were from the Deep South, or if they were from Texas versus Missouri. And that was really fun. I got in trouble a lot though, because I would keep talking a little longer than I was supposed to. But it\u2019s fun talking to people. I enjoy talking to people, and hearing their stories, so. Yeah, that\u2019s definitely true."

And all computerized, it\u2019s kind of like NASA: You go into this dark dark room, no windows. And in the front of the room there\u2019s a huge board that just has different colors on it that signify different things. Um, and they just track the progress of the train, and it\u2019s so cool.

Well, daddy decided he\u2019s going to buy him a farm, so he bought a 60-acre farm not too far from where we, uh, lived. And I helped hoe and pick cotton [laughs], oh my goodness, and when I got 18 years old then finished high school, I, I left. I didn\u2019t have to do that anymore, but um, that\u2019s just the way they did back then. The children, they had children so they could work in the field and all. That sounds silly, doesn\u2019t it? But I tell you, my mom and dad was really good to us though. I, I have friends say that they went hungry, they didn\u2019t have food to eat, or anything hardly to wear, we always had nice clothes, we always had food to eat, anytime, anything we wanted, we had it. And I never had to, um \u2026 [Interviewer: \u201cThis was during the Depression, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d] Yeah, it was. And you know, people had to, uh, people went around to the really the people that didn\u2019t have food and stuff, and give them food and stuff. But, praise the Lord, we never did have to get it. Because we, uh, farmed and mama canned a lot. She\u2019d, it\u2019d, now they freeze it and everything. Well, she started freezing it before she passed away. We had just about everything, you know, we need \u2014 we had everything we needed out there. And, uh, and, it, it was really nice. And then I came to Columbia when I was 18 years old, and of course whenever my husband was in service, I traveled around with him some."

Maybe a \u2014 more like a little hamlet, \u2019bout (uh) 20 miles north of (uh) Nashville. Ridgetop is up on a \u2014 sort of a plateau, an\u2019 the air was nice an\u2019 crisp an\u2019 clean up there, \u2019n\u2019\u2026 Have a lot o\u2019 fon\u2019 childhood mem\u2019ries, but one that I guess I\u2019ll never forget was the time when \u2014 we lived in a house, an\u2019 there was a dirt road beside our house, \u2019n\u2019 there was a family that lived further down this road, an\u2019 they were really poor people. An\u2019 there was a fella there, his name was Julian. I guess Julian was the \u2014 one of the sons of Mrs. Adams. He had a brother, Slim Adams. An\u2019 Julian lived in a little short trailer house, like a little mini camper-thing. It was a tiny little thing, an\u2019 he\u2013 he cooked an\u2019\u2013 an\u2019 heated by wood: wood fire, wood stove, an\u2019 Julian would take me possum huntin\u2019 in the woods at night. He had an ol\u2019 dog. I think the dog\u2019s name was\u2013 he called him \u201cShep.\u201d Was just an old cur dog. An\u2019 I was at the age \u2014 about the time when I was (um) experimenting with smoking cigarettes, so I\u2019d use the excuse, for Julian to take me hunting in the woods, to go out an\u2019 smoke cigarettes at night, so, one night I decided I want to get out, \u2019n\u2019 this was before I had a car. \u2019at was probably 14 years old, or so. An\u2019 I went down to Julian\u2019s place, an\u2019 it was dark. An\u2019 I walked down \u2019at long dirt road, \u2019n\u2019 got to Julian\u2019s house, an\u2019 I said, \u201cJulian, take me (uh) \u2014 Let\u2019s go possum huntin\u2019.\u201d He said, \u201cNow, it\u2019s not a good night. The moon\u2019s not right. We wouldn\u2019t do any good.\u201d I said, \u201cWell, we could go anyway,\u201d so I\u2013 finally I talked him into goin\u2019, an\u2019 he called the dog, got the dog there, an\u2019 I said, (uh) \u201cWhere\u2019s your gun?\u201d An\u2019 he said, \u201cI\u2019m tellin\u2019 ya we\u2019re not goin\u2019 do any good tonight, so I\u2019m not even gonna take the gun.\u201d So we left an\u2019 we went way out in the woods, deep down in the woods, \u2019n\u2019 heard the dog start barkin\u2019 \u2019n \u2019bout 10 minutes. He said, \u201cWell, that dog\u2019s got somethin\u2019 treed down there, so \u2026\u201d We walked an\u2019 walked through the woods. It was pitch black. I mean, just terribly dark, quiet, an\u2019 all you could hear were our own footsteps, kinda crunchin\u2019 through the leaves an\u2019 the branches of the woods. An\u2019 this was in the fall, an\u2019 it \u2014 but it was a warm night. So he had the flashlight with \u2019im, an\u2019 he\u2019s shinin\u2019 flashlight aroun\u2019, an\u2019 we could hear the dog barkin\u2019. By the sound o\u2019 the dog, we kinda homed in on where the \u2014 where the dog was. An\u2019 we got to this tree. An\u2019 the dog was right under the tree, lookin\u2019 straight up, just yellin\u2019 \u2019is little head off, y\u2019know. Shine that flashlight up, sure enough, up in that tree was a \u2014 just a big fat possum. An\u2019 the tree wasn\u2019t \u2014 but about, maybe six inches in diameter. It wa\u2019n\u2019t real tall, an\u2019 the leaves had already fallen off this tree, because it was fall. But there were still a lotta other trees \u2019t had leaves on \u2019em. So Julian said, \u201cBoy, \u2019a\u2019 sure is a nice possum. I hate to let that thing get away.\u201d An\u2019 I said, \u201cWell, I told ya to bring the gun.\u201d An\u2019 he said, \u201cWell, I tell you what,\u201d said, \u201cyou stay here, an\u2019 you make noise. An\u2019 that possum won\u2019 come down. An\u2019 I\u2019ll go back an\u2019 get the gun.\u201d An\u2019 I said, \u201cOK.\u201d So he had the flashlight, an\u2019 he left an\u2019 I could see, an\u2019 hear \u2018im, walkin\u2019 off in the distance. An\u2019 the light got fainter an\u2019 dimmer, y\u2019know. An\u2019 finally it got outta sight. When he was gone, an\u2019 the light was gone, it got really black in those woods. \u2019n\u2019 if you\u2019ve ever been in the woods late at night, it gets kinda scary with all the sounds \u2019n\u2019 things, that start comin\u2019 back to life after you\u2019ve quiet\u2019d down for a little while, so, I was there, an\u2019 course the dog, then knowin\u2019 that we had found the possum; tThe dog left, an\u2019 ran off somewhere else, so it was jus\u2019 me there, under that tree with that possum. In about ten or 15 minutes, but it seemed like about an hour an\u2019 a half, I could hear these sounds in the woods, \u2019n\u2019it sounded like somethin\u2019 walkin.\u2019 An\u2019 I thought, \u2019ll that may be a bobcat or a bear or somethin\u2019, so I started gettin\u2019 a little scared. So I climbed up in that tree, to git off the ground \u2019n\u2019\u2026 I c\u2019d climb up a six-inch tree pretty good at that age. I got up in there an\u2019 got on a couple o\u2019 the lower limbs an\u2019 jus\u2019 kinda set there, \u2019n\u2019 wrap my arm aroun\u2019 the tree, one o\u2019 the limbs \u2019n\u2019 jus\u2019 hung on. After a little while, I could hear the noise o\u2019 Julian comin\u2019 back aroun\u2019 the\u2013 the hillside. I c\u2019d see the light flashin\u2019 a little bit, knew he was gettin\u2019 close. He started callin\u2019 to me, \u201cWhere are ya?\u201d I\u2019d say, \u201cHere I am.\u201d An\u2019 he kep\u2019 comin\u2019 closer, an\u2019 then I c\u2019d see the actual beam of light \u2019s he got a little closer. \u201cWhere are you?\u201d I said, \u201cRight here.\u201d \u2018\u2019n\u2019 he\u2019s shinin\u2019 the light all around on the ground. He said, \u201cWhere? I can\u2019t see ya.\u201d I said, \u201cRight here, right here,\u201d an\u2019 he kep\u2019 shinin\u2019 but he didn\u2019 see me \u2019n\u2019 I said, \u201cUp here.\u201d An\u2019 then he started laughin\u2019, and said, \u201cUp where?\u201d An\u2019 he shined the light up, an\u2019 there I was in that tree with \u2019at possum. So when he shined the light up, over my head, I looked up, \u2019n\u2019 that possum was about two feet over my head. I mean jus\u2019 right \u2014 I c\u2019d reach up and touch the possum. So he said, \u201cWell, if I\u2019d known you c\u2019d climb that tree like that, I wouldn\u2019\u2019a\u2019 gone back for that gun, I\u2019d just had you bring the possum down.\u201d I said, \u201cYou\u2019re crazy. I\u2019m not goin\u2019 bring this possum down.\u201d He said, \u201cNo. All you gotta do\u2019s jus\u2019 grab \u2019im by the tail, an\u2019 tug a little bit \u2019n\u2019 possum\u2019ll jus\u2019 \u2014 they kinda go into\u2013 what we call \u201cplayin\u2019 possum.\u201d They git scared.\u201d An\u2019 tha\u2013 he called it solling [spelling?]. An\u2019 I said, \u201cNo.\u201d He said, \u201cReally. I don\u2019 wanna shoot that possum. Jus\u2019 grab \u2019im by the tail an\u2019 tug a little bit, an\u2019 you can jus\u2019 literally pull \u2019im right down the tree.\u201d So I got real bold an\u2019 I did. I reached up an\u2019 I grabbed \u2019im by the tail. An\u2019 that possum curled that ol\u2019 rat tail roun\u2019 my han\u2019, an\u2019 I tugged a little bit, an\u2019 started pullin\u2019 down, followin\u2019 Julian\u2019s instructions. The possum was just kinda holdin\u2019 onto the tree, an\u2019 he started sorta backin\u2019 down. An\u2019 I got down, started climbin\u2019 down the tree, pullin\u2019 this possum down the tree. So, when I got low enough, Julian came over. Then he reached up, \u2019n\u2019 grabbed the possum \u2019n\u2019 grabbed it by the tail, \u2019n\u2019 shook it real hard, \u2019n\u2019 the possum played dead. We walked outta the woods, \u2019n\u2019 he was carryin\u2019 that possum by the tail, upside-down, an\u2019 I\u2019ll never forget that s\u2019 long as I live. So when we got back, I said, \u201cWhat\u2019re ya goin\u2019 do with it?\u201d He said, \u201cWell, I\u2019m gonna cook this thing tomorrow.\u201d So he had an ol\u2019 garbage can that ju\u2019 looked like\u2019 bout a 50-gallon metal can or somethin.\u2019 He took the top off \u2019n\u2019 put that possum down in, \u2019n\u2019 slammed the top down on that can. \u2019N\u2019 I went on home an\u2019 the nex\u2019 day, I saw \u2019im, an\u2019 I said, \u201cJulian, did ja cook that possum?\u201d He said, \u201cSure was good. I saved some for you.\u201d An\u2019 I said, \u201cI might can pull one out of a tree, but I\u2019m never gonna eat one.\u201d So, that was my experience with Julian Adams an\u2019 the possum."

    "unscripted_text": "I was born in Mart, Texas, in a house, not in a hospital, and as many of my contemporaries were. Mart, Texas, is a cotton farmland area at that time that was inhabited mostly by three ethnic groups. Number one, which I belong to and come from, is pure Scots-Irish. The dominant ethnic group of Texas and the dominant culture of Texas is essentially a Scots-Celtic culture and I was born into that. My grandfather was born in Texas at the same town in a wagon. His father was killed on a cattle drive and his mother probably was a Cherokee squaw that he had picked up in east Texas before the Civil War. So that\u2019s on my mother\u2019s side. On my father\u2019s side my great-grandfather came as a child, I mean my great-great grandfather, came as a child to Texas in 1845 from Mississippi/Tennessee area. The Curlies came was typical Scots that fleed the battle of Argoden \u2014 I mean Caloden \u2014 came to the United States, fought in the Revolutionary War, started going west, and they were typical Scots-Irish frontiers men. Part of the family came to Texas. Another part of the family went to Missouri and started the clothing manufacturing store \u2026 business. So my family were just poor Scots-Irish dirt farmers. In my community, that Mark was raised in, we had Germans on one side of town, they had farms generally, and the best- the best farms the Germans had. The other side of town were the little best, not quite as nice a farms, were the Czechs, and then the majority of the people there were Scots-Irish and then a large, \u2019bout third of \u2019em, were black farm workers. So all of those three things contributed to the language. I think that essentially the language is dominated by the Celtic\u2019s Scots-Irish way of thinking and talking. One of the things that is in small towns in Texas, and mines the same way, is everyone has a nickname Every single person nearly has a nickname and that is \u2014 just goes through the whole town. We had, that\u2019s both black and white, one of the- one of the black guys was called The Shadow because he was so, so black. If in one of the kids \u2014 and you got these nicknames from things that happened to ya as a child and they were usually very embarrassing things like a kid that \u2014 whose nose ran a lot or had a lot of colds or stuff, he was called Booger. And he called Booger the rest of his life. One kid, they caught him eating bugs when he was a child, he was eating these little doodle bugs, and so for the rest of his, his life his names was Bugsy. Hickey was a guy that had a big boil on the back of his- on his butt. His name was Hickey Butt. My nickname was Guildersleeve. And that came from the way I laughed when I was a child because there was a radio character named Guildersleeve on the radio in the forties and thirties, and that\u2019s where my nickname came. And, and my family still calls me that. So first thing is: Everybody has a nickname."

    "unscripted_text": "I grew up \u2014 I was born in 1938 in a little town called Weslaco, Texas, which is right in the center of the valley, of the Rio Grande Valley, which is very close to the Mexican border, Reynosa. An\u2019 I went all the way through elementary school an\u2019 high school there. (Um) Our school had about 400 people in it. (Uh) An\u2019 the val- as I was telling you earlier, about half o\u2019 those \u2014 half of the town was Mexican-American. The other half o\u2019 the town was Anglo. We had no blacks, no Asian-Americans. Y\u2019know, there was no other culture that I can recall bein\u2019 represented there. It was a typical growing up time in the fifties. (Uh) President Eisenhower came to the valley, an\u2019 went down the highway, an\u2019 I waved at him. (Um) I met Harry Truman one time, also. But (uh) it was just a typical, \u201cHappy Days\u201d-type growing up. (Uh) Y\u2019know, drive-in movies, (uh) Dairy Queens. We went everywhere in groups. Hardly anyone dated. The locals \u2014 oh, then polio was a big thing back then too. So (uh), for about two summers, they closed the movie theatres, and the swi- the public swimming pools. Y\u2019 couldn\u2019t do anything. An\u2019 just random people, y\u2019know, (uh) developed polio, so there\u2019s \u2014 (uh) that was a real scary time. (Um) I had ten best friends, and we jus- \u2026 we ran around together. We had our picture made together. We had slumber parties together. And we even still now (uh) communicate with each other, an\u2019 we\u2019re all in our sixties, so that was fun. (Uh) So it was a very laid back, very secure, very innocent time. And (uh) there\u2019s no- \u2026 y\u2019know, there was a little smoking behind the barn or whatever, but there was no- \u2026 y\u2019know, no drug culture. Very little alcohol. I guess the guys pro\u2019bly drank beer. [Clears throat] There was a very \u2014 you were expected to go to college, in, in, at least in my culture, my crowd, my family. You were expected t\u2019 go to college. You were expected not to have sex before you got married. You were expected to (uh) go to church every Sunday. It was that kind of a thing, an\u2019 we didn\u2019t question it. An\u2019 the interesting thing is, that most of the people that I knew, that I grew up with, an\u2019 stuff, (um) have turned out to be the most secure, happy people. So I don\u2019t know. Y\u2019know, I don\u2019t know the answer to all tha-that\u2019s, y\u2019know, beyon\u2019 me, but \u2026 They\u2019re all very, y\u2019know, there hasn\u2019t been really any suicides, or any alcoholism, or any, y\u2019know, great, terrible, tragic things. But on the other hand, we weren\u2019t very creative or very, y\u2019know, we never \u2014 nobody\u2019s ever set the world on fire. Nobody\u2019s ever written the world\u2019s greatest poem, or the world\u2019s greatest music. Maybe we weren\u2019t tortured enou\u2026"

And (um) we wanted a southern climate. We were tired of the snow, up there, so we came to Texas. And (uh) at that point in time, I had had all my three children. An\u2019 (uh) then we came to (uh) Houston area. It\u2019s where we came to, to live. An\u2019 bought a home there, an\u2019 (um) \u2026 so that was the cr\u2013 \u2026 We started our life in Texas. An\u2019 a few years later I divorced, and then I lived in Galveston, and Mission, Texas, which is near McAllen, an\u2019 San Antonio. An\u2019 then up here in Austin, which \u2014 I got my job at UT, an\u2019 I (uh) worked in the UT theatre and events department for 19 years. Put in some good hours there in the academic area, which I love very much. An\u2019 now I\u2019m retired, an\u2019 still live here in Austin. An\u2019 (uh) I have (uh) grandchildren here, an\u2019 family, an\u2019 \u2026 so I enjoy bein\u2019 retired very much, an\u2019 (uh) I always suggest it for ev\u2019rybody. Yeah I (um) didn\u2019 really know much about theatre, before I got the position here in the department. An\u2019 so it, it spawned a great love for the theatre now. An\u2019 I love to go an\u2019 see things. An\u2019 we\u2019ve had so many shows here. An\u2019 one show I got to see \u2014 there was professional group came in, was the performance of (uh) Phantom of the Opera. That was very good \u2026 at Performing Arts Center. But I\u2019ve seen many, many shows here in the department. I mean, from little scenes to big productions, an\u2019 this department is just \u2014 It\u2019s amazing, what the students do. It\u2019s like theatre: They say theatre is magic, an\u2019 I believe that, beca\u2013 [chortles] Y\u2019can see all these rehearsals, which \u2014 I had taken part in some (uh) things here. I\u2019ve, I\u2019ve gotten involved in theatre (uh), since I (uh) became to love it. And (uh) I worked on some professional shows, up in town, as (uh) sound. And (uh) even did a l \u2014 couple little walk-in parts as (uh) an actor. An\u2019 I\u2019ve done lights. I got involved in (uh) props. So, I got a little taste o\u2019 theatre so I could know what these students are goin\u2019 through an\u2019 when they talk to me, I can better relate to what they\u2019re talkin\u2019 about. So (uh), I also work with Michael Harlan, who\u2019s (uh) directin\u2019 shows at Capitol City Playhouse, which we no longer have anymore, but it was a great venue for, for good theatre in Austin. An\u2019 he produced (uh) The Seagull an\u2019 (uh) Biloxi Blues, both of which I did sound, sound operator for those shows. An\u2019 (um), so I, I\u2019ve spent a lotta time in the department plus I\u2019ve actually worked in theatre a little bit, so I, I\u2019ve learned to really love it more an\u2019 more even being involved. Y\u2019know, so, it\u2019s been great experience here in Austin."

I lef\u2019 there when I was, uh, 18, went in the Marine Corps. I\u2019s in the Marine Corps fo\u2019 three years, got out an\u2019 then I, uh, I moved down to the Conroe area. I was, uh \u2014 I went to work for Uncle Sam when I got out. I was an air-traffic controller \u2019til the big strike of \u201981. An\u2019 to avoid, uh, any problems with the government, \u2019cause o\u2019 me leadin\u2019 a strike against the U.S. government, I went to live in Central America for 11 months. An\u2019 then, uh, when that\u2013 ev\u2019rything kinda faded away; well I, um, I came back an\u2019 went to work. Uh, I\u2019ve always ranched an\u2019 done things like \u2019at, \u2019n\u2019\u2013 but I, like I say, I was an air-traffic controller [?] into the Marine Corps. I, uh, I ranched down to the southern end of New Mexico. Arizona was my western boundary, and Mexico\u2019s my southern boundary, an\u2019 it\u2019s real rugged, real rough country down there. Ranched there for, I guess, two years, two/three years. Then I moved up to the Chama area on the north en\u2019, like north o\u2019 Santa Fe by a hundred miles. An\u2019, uh, I was there \u2019til, I guess, eight years ago when I moved back to \u2014 moved to Denton, an\u2019, uh, lived there for three years, an\u2019 then I moved down to south Texas. I had a ranch down southeast of, uh, Nixon, for a while. An\u2019 then my dad got ill, an\u2019 I moved back here to New Braunfels in [?], an\u2019 what, uh \u2014 in a real short, uh, [unclear]. On Walker, Texas Ranger . Yeah, I had livestock on it. Oh, I did that for \u2014 had that for three years, an\u2019 then, uh, some reason, I didn\u2019t think, y\u2019know, the show was ever gonna last, so I quit [?] on, but eight years later, it\u2019s still goin\u2019. But, uh, that\u2019s really \u2019bout it. I \u2014 there\u2019s jus\u2019 not a whole lot. I just travel round a lot. Uh, I always kinda felt you stay in one place too long, you grow roots, and, uh, that\u2019s somethin\u2019 I don\u2019t want. But, uh, uh, like I say, I been \u2026 When, when my father got ill, I moved back here to Braunfels. My dad was raised \u2014 Interstate 30 past the Royal Home Place down here, out there Lyman Road, an\u2019 I sort \u2014 oh, got all family round here, so \u2026 Y\u2019know, I don\u2019 know. It\u2019s, uh, I haven\u2019t really figured it out. I just \u2014 it\u2019s, uh, pretty simple. I mean, there\u2019s not \u2014 it\u2019s not a \u2014 it doesn\u2019t take a brainchild to do it. Just, there\u2019s not lotsa hours in the thing, so, um, but I been doin\u2019 this for off \u2019n\u2019 on for about 17 years. E\u2019en when I got back from, uh, when I got back from Central America. When I was in New Mexico after it \u2013 I, I ran Jurgens all the time, an\u2019, uh, once I\u2019d shipped my cattle, in October, then I\u2019d either go to California or Arizona or come back to Texas, or somewhere \u2019n\u2019 work on the movies until, uh, y\u2019know, the winter down here on the real southern end. An\u2019 then, uh, that April or May I\u2019d go back home an\u2019 start receivin\u2019 my cattle again. An\u2019 then, uh, there in Chama, o\u2019 course, that\u2019s way up in the mountains there at my house; that\u2019s 82-62, an\u2019 up to 13,000 a back, so, there an awful lot o\u2019 guide an\u2019 trout, uh, trout fishin\u2019, an\u2019 o\u2019 course when the hunt started, we, we hunted, um, elk, uh, deer, bear, an\u2019, uh, lion. But that was \u2014 that\u2019s prob\u2019ly best part \u2014 the most fun in life, right there. Headin\u2019 out gotta have the world by the, by the tail. Y\u2019know, it\u2019s horseback all day, an\u2019 I was huntin\u2019 an\u2019 fishin\u2019, y\u2019know, didn\u2019 have a worry in the world. But, uh, that\u2019s somethin\u2019 that, uh, \u2014 that not very many people get to experience. But there\u2019s \u2014 I mean, that ol\u2019 country up there is young, the heart \u2019n\u2019 soul. We just hardly make a livin\u2019 up there. Y\u2019know, we got snow up the armpits about six months outta the year. No, I was fixin\u2019 a wind- \u2026 Well, that, that, that\u2019s kind of a long story too. Not \u2014 most people don\u2019t have \u2014 windmill\u2019s kind of a thing of the past, but, uh, the whole motor an\u2019 ev\u2019rything; it\u2019s a wind-generated pump, and you have the \u2014 the circuit rods runs all the way down in, into your well, on the \u2013 at, at the end o\u2019 your pipe then you have your leathers. It\u2019s \u2014 actually pumps the water up an\u2019 p\u2013 forces it up the pipe an\u2019, well, that\u2019s the main thing, is your w- \u2026 your leathers wear out, \u2019n\u2019 you have to pull all your stuff, all the rods out, redo your leathers, an\u2019 put ev\u2019rything back in. Dependin\u2019 on the dee- the depth of the well, that could, that could be a two- or three-day operation, but, uh, that \u2014 an\u2019 that\u2019s really kind of a joke. Like to say it\u2019s kind of a los- \u2026 y\u2019know, nobody does that no more. Well, I\u2019m, I\u2019m kinda down right now, and I s\u2013 I kinda sold ev\u2019rything, \u2019cause I started travelin\u2019 so much, an\u2019 been so dry. I had a ranch out, out in West Texas an\u2019 had, uh, seven inches o\u2019 rain in five years, an\u2019 that\u2019s hard for a lizard to make a living. But, uh, I used to raise, uh, red runner cattle an\u2019 then, uh, then when I got in the yearlin\u2019 operation, I thought, y\u2019know, anyway it\u2019s not year-round. I don\u2019t know whoever came up with the word cowboy. Anyway, it\u2019s not cowboy, it\u2019s cow-nurse. Y\u2019know, \u2019cause you\u2019re something \u2014 you\u2019re, you\u2019re nursing ev\u2019rything all the time. Your animals\u2019ll get very dependent on \u2026"

An\u2019 then, on Sunday afternoons, people are very relaxed aroun\u2019 town. You\u2019ll see people out in their yards going w\u2013 for walks, occasionally riding horses out in my area, and, um, during the week there are, uh, not a lotta things to do, I guess. There\u2019s \u2014 mainly just go to work an\u2019 on Thursday nights of course, like anywhere, you can find people out at the bars. Um, families there are very, I would say, family-oriented. They\u2019re very traditional families, that, uh \u2014 I think holds different from a lotta different areas in Texas. There\u2019s not a lot of variety. I think we\u2019re kinda single-minded.

And he would just trust us to go out with this horse any time. He knew that \u2014 I mean, horses can be dangerous, but he didn\u2019t think this horse was dangerous. We could go out there, \u2019n\u2019 we\u2019d stand up on the rabbit cage, \u2019cause of course we\u2019re too short to saddle it up.

We\u2019d just kick it \u2019n\u2019 he would just walk all around the whole pasture, and we just decided, \u201cOK, we\u2019re gonna close our eyes.\u201d So we jus\u2019 kind of, almost took a nap on the horse.

Because it was the only time that we actually did that, where you close your eyes, but he still did exactly what we would \u2019a\u2019 done if we would have had our eyes open and been leading him. It was like he didn\u2019t even need to be led; he already knew where to go. So anyway, he was trained really well.

You wouldn\u2019 think that people would say anything to you, unless you\u2019d go outta state or somethin\u2019 like that, which \u2019d definitely get \u2014 \u2019cause we say y\u2019 all, an\u2019 ev\u2019rybo\u2013 ev\u2019rywhere I go people wanna know if I say y\u2019 all, an\u2019 I\u2019m like, \u201cNo, we don\u2019t say y\u2019all,\u201d an\u2019 then when I leave, I\u2019m like, \u201cOK, \u2019bye, y\u2019all!\u201d An\u2019 they\u2019re like, \u201cAw, caughtcha.\u201d Anyway, so I reall\u2013 I do say \u201cy\u2019all\u201d a lot. (Um) But my family would comment on it too. They\u2019re like, \u201cYou\u2019re real country.\u201d An\u2019 they \u2014 ev\u2019rybody would mock me, either my family, or school. Anyway, they would repeat things that I would say as soon as I would say it. An\u2019 I\u2019m like, \u201cI\u2019m not country.\u201d An\u2019 they\u2019re like, \u201cYes, you are.\u201d An\u2019 I\u2019m like, \u201cNo, I\u2019m not.\u201d An\u2019 it would jus\u2019 get worse from there, so I\u2019d jus\u2019 have to stop talkin\u2019, \u2019cause it would get so twangy that I, I, I couldn\u2013 I couldn\u2019t even listen to myself. An\u2019 (um) my brother used to get mad at me, \u2019cause he listens alternative music, and I was \u2014 I\u2019d know some of the words, and I\u2019d kinda start singin\u2019 and he\u2019d say, \u201cPlease stop because you\u2019re makin\u2019 it sound so country, an\u2019\u2026 it\u2019s not a country song.\u201d An\u2019, y\u2019know, even a couple years ago he said it again, he\u2019s like, \u201cYou make every song country.\u201d Just, y\u2019know, don\u2019t do it. [Subject sings:] \u201cIt\u2019s amazing how you can speak right to my heart. Without sayin\u2019 a word you light up the dark. Try as I may I could never explain what I hear when you don\u2019t say a thing.\u201d An\u2019 that one is country, but another one that\u2019s alternative sounds just as country. [She sings again.:] \u201cDespite all my rage I am still just a rat in a cage, for someone to say what is lost can never be saved.\u201d An\u2019 that is a totally alternative song, y\u2019know, hard-core, heavy metal, an\u2019 \u2019s nothing country about it, but somehow I tend to make it country. \u2026"

Then we came back to Beaumont, and about \u201955, we left Beaumont and went to Traverse City, Michigan. They didn\u2019t like Southerners; they were all Yankees. They made fun of my accent. They didn\u2019t eat chicken, didn\u2019t eat no fried chicken at all. And my mother would whenever my cub scouts would meet, my cub scout group, they\u2019d ask my mother if she was going to have chicken, because one time she made the mistake of feeding them fried chicken, and then from then on they thought that was all we ate. And they were always going to call their mothers and not go home and eat at Mrs. Sterling\u2019s house, because they wanted to eat her fried chicken. I lived in Michigan with my two sisters, Patsy and Susie, and we took care of a hotel; my great uncle had a owned a hotel in Traverse City, Michigan, about a four-story hotel on the main drag of town. And my grandmother ran the hotel for him, and mother periodically was ill many times when she was in the 50s. And so during one of these times, Momee, my grandmother, said \u201cLook, let\u2019s everybody move to Michigan, and we\u2019ll take care of everybody up there,\u201d and that\u2019s what we did. We went to school, started school in 1957, there in Michigan. And the girls took care of the hotel, cleaning up and doing the stuff that needed to be done to run the hotel. And Momma worked there too. And then, I don\u2019t know, in 1959 we came back, so I guess we was there from \u201950 somewhere \u201957, maybe early \u201957, spring \u201957 all the way through the spring of \u201959, which seemed like a lot longer than two years, but it was I guess just two years. And then we went to Austin, Texas. Stayed there from \u201959 til \u201960, \u201961 I think, and then we went to Pasadena, Texas. And I was in Pasadena during Hurricane Carla, which would have been September of 1961. And then I stayed in Pasadena all the way through til about 1972, moved to Bellaire, Texas. I was 22 years old then."

I spent eight days, just being sick every time I ate or drank any water; fell out of a guard tower, I was passing out, so they put me uh, on a cot in a bunker, and, uh, my job was to rest until we went back to town. \u2018Cause we were three hours out from the nearest base. Driving. And by helicopter, ironically. The nearest military facility, by helicopter, was three hours and the nearest base period was three hours by vehicle. So I was just waiting for time to pass so I could go back to the main base so we could get to check in with the medics and stuff. The medic \u2014 we had one medic who was a PFC he\u2019d come check but there was nothing abnormal. 101 fever, sinus arrhythmia, irregular heart beat stuff. Just everybody had that, cause we were in the middle of the desert, it was just kind of expected. So, everybody, you know \u2014 I didn\u2019t stand out as anything severe until I left the shade, because I was always in the shade, and I went and I suddenly felt better one day, and went to take a shower and I couldn\u2019t wash the grime off. And the showers like water bottles in a bucket with holes stabbed in it, so you get this drip and I just figured inadequate facilities, therefore I couldn\u2019t get clean. So I scrub scrubbed right out of bottled water, and I couldn\u2019t get it off. So I\u2019m walking back and I felt good and the uh, radio operator was like, he\u2019s like, \u201cDude you look yellow, maybe you should go see the medic.\u201d And I was like, \u201cUh? What are you talking about \u2014 yellow? Whatever.\u201d So I look in the mirror, and uh, and I was yellow. So I went to the medic and I was like, \u201cHey Doc! Look me in the whites of the eyes and tell me I\u2019m gonna live!\u201d and he said, \u201cYou\u2019re getting medevaced.\u201d And so they called for the helicopter, cause apparently my liver had failed so I was jaundiced. And, uh, so they shipped me back to Kandahar, and they had to refuel halfway there so there\u2019s three helicopters, it was a Black Hawk and two Apache escorts. And so that was an expensive for taxpayers trip I\u2019m sure, but \u2014 and then, uh when I got to Kandahar, to the surgical facility, I had a red cell blood count a two. So I was suffocating. They gave me two blood transfusions. Immediately. They like \u2014 it was, \u201cWho is A positive?\u201d And one of the medics starts slap\u2014started slapping his wrist right there and uh, that was \u2014 he was \u2014 he was giving up \u2014 that was the last thing that remember before I passed out was him getting ready to give up blood, just so they could put it straight into me. And uh, so then I woke up in Germany, I guess? I, I don\u2019t remember anything in Germany, I was in the hospital there for three week in ICU and I caused all sorts of problems. I, every time that I gained consciousness I thought I\u2019d been captured so I would assault people and try to escape. But I\u2019d lost like 45 pounds of muscle so I was like a sloppy wet fish and I just, flail around and slap tubes at people. So nobody really got hurt other than me. But I was just, the the pain cause I always \u2014 when I figured that I couldn\u2019t do anything else and I\u2019d try to mess with the machinery, so I\u2019d always change the settings on all my life support equipment, and everything and that \u2026 the doctors get irritated. Uh, I pulled out an A line once, I had a trach; that was fun being on a ventilator. Changing the ventilator settings is one of the things that stressed them out. The uh, interesting fact: they screw the plugs into the walls in the ICU so that you can\u2019t pull the plug on the life support. So that\u2019s kind of a misnomer when they say, \u201cPull the plug.\u201d Cause you can\u2019t. Cause they\u2019re attached mechanically to the wall. And uh, but it\u2019s, yeah, it\u2019s interesting. And uh, let\u2019s see. Other fun things I learned in the hospital that uh, the little green star in the green wristband mean you\u2019re a fall hazard. So if you, uh, try to get out of bed your face is gonna meet the floor before your second foot does and then they get mad about that, too. But uh, after I got stabilized they sent me to Walter Reed in D.C. where I tried to jump off the roof of the heli\u2014 the roof of the hospital, when we got out of the helicopter. Because I thought I\u2019d been captured again. I distinctly remember thinking, \u201cThere\u2019s no buildings taller than two stories in Afghanistan. So I\u2019m just gonna run and jump off this thing and get away from these guys.\u201d So as soon as the helicopter landed I brushed them out of the way, I made like, three steps out of the helicopter before I collapsed. But I was firmly intent on jumping off the side of that building, which is seven stories to pavement or concrete. And it would have been a horrible way to end all that tax payer investment."

Um, there was probably \u2014 within like, I don\u2019t know, fifty-mile radius of where I lived, there was probably no more than\u2026a hundred people. So, it was really small. Um, but I liked it, especially as a young kid growing up; there was really nice \u2018cause lots of room to run and play and make noise and you could do all kinds of fun stuff. And so we\u2019d always build forts and do things. Being in Moscow, Russia, was really interesting; uh, it was such a different perspective on, just, world views and lives, being able to live in a different culture like that for a little while. I actually got to live with a family and uh, you know, I ate with them, and I mean I got to live with a Russian family for, I think I was there for about two or three months, um, but, I mean it wasn\u2019t like I was a, a tourist there. I actually got to kind of experience what it was like. And it was really neat. And I got to see, uh, Swan Lake at the Kremlin. There in Moscow. And so that was really amazing. Um, Hawaii, of course, was beautiful. I uh, got to go there, uh \u2014 I went down there because my brother was getting married.

An\u2019 my city\u2019s up in the mountains more than any other one around it, so we get a lot more snow than anybody else, but I loved it. And I used to live in a place called Hillsville, Virginia, an\u2019 that\u2019s about two and a half hours away from there, an\u2019 that\u2019s more \u2014 it\u2019s lower to the ground. It\u2019s almost on (um) ocean level. But the, the dialect was different, but I really like it too, and I s\u2013 went to Kindergarten there. An\u2019 my very first theatre experience, when I knew I wanted to be in it for the rest of my life \u2014 I was in \u2014 I was 5 years old, an\u2019 my two best friends an\u2019 I were in the Christmas play, and one \u2014 and they were both boys. I was \u2014 ev\u2019rybody was so jealous of me. An\u2019 they were both in love with me, and (um) one of \u2019em was Santa, an\u2019 the other was a reindeer, an\u2019 me an\u2019 the other reindeer had to get on our hands and knees an\u2019 crawl an\u2019 bring the Santa in. An\u2019 the night of the performance, we wrecked. We hit the \u2014 one of the places where all the kids were standin\u2019, an\u2019 Santa fell off. His beard fell off, his hat fell off, so ev\u2019rybody started laughin\u2019 but I loved the attention, and I knew from then on that\u2019s what I wanted to do. And then, our other performance that year, we had \u2014 ev\u2019rybody had a letter, and ev\u2019rybody had to get up in front of all the audience and say their letter, say a little poem about the letter, an\u2019 then sing a song about it. I was so proud, because I was the only person that had one letter to themself. Ev\u2019rybody else was in twos or threes or fours. And my letter was S, and I still to this day can remember the poem. It\u2019s, \u201cS is for seesaws and swings painted blue. It\u2019s also for sliding boards an\u2019 sandboxes too.\u201d My p_____ knows the rest, which is really funny. I can\u2019t remember it. An\u2019 then I sang \u201cIt\u2019s a Small, Small World.\u201d And from then on I knew that I wanted to do theatre, an\u2019 I tried to study somewhat in school; my high school an\u2019 middle school, but we had such a limited program that that was not much of an option. But I enjoyed my life there."

From North Carolina we moved to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. From Pennsylvania we moved to Indianapolis, Indiana, and from there, back to Virginia.

As a child, I was pretty well spoiled, as I was the oldest grandchild on either side of the family. Therefore I received an inordinate amount of attention. My mother thought I was absolutely perfect, and entered me into anything happening. (Uh) I learned how to do the Chinese ballet as an infant, and of course, she gave me all the social graces, which were very important back in the thirties. (Uh) As I grew, I (uh) found out that there were manly things, which my father introduced me to, such as (uh) visiting the farm, as a small child, and staying with my grandparents, finding out about a whole \u2019nother world. (Uh) My grandfather, who was quite a strict fellow, (uh) very hard worker, taught me how to shoot my first gun. What didn\u2019 bother to tell me was that a 36-inch barrel, 12-gauge shotgun was not what a 8-year-old kid should shoot. I ended up with a very large bruise on my shoulder, an\u2019 my grandfather stayed in hot water with my mother for some time thereafter. But I did brag about shootin\u2019 a big gun. And I shot a big rabbit, too. Well, \u2019n\u2019 havin\u2019 to \u2014 (uh) as we grew (uh, uh) \u2014 one o\u2019 the high points of my life, of course, was (uh) when I graduated from high school.

(Uh) I didn\u2019 know it at the time, that our relationship would last this long, because that\u2019s not what I had planned. The first time that I asked her out, I thought it was a temporary thing.

She tol\u2019 me of the wallpaper with the roses, an\u2019 of the beautiful organdy lace curtains at the window. I was raised in Martinsville, Virginia; schooled, loved, an\u2019 married there. Our second child was borned in Martinsville. My father, a born-an\u2019-bred North Carolinian, met, wooed and married my mother. In fact, they eloped, back to North Carolina to be married. Martinsville, at the time that I was growin\u2019 up, was a small little community, but by the time I hit high school, DuPont had built a plant there, an\u2019 from all over the country came these foreigners, with dialects we didn\u2019t quite understand, but who improved the quality of life in Martinsville immensely. The education system in our high school was equal to the first two years of college in any university in Virginia. I married my husband in Martinsville, Virginia. We left there, an\u2019 after 20-some moves, have come to Alabama. Martinsville was located on that edge of the Carolina line, an\u2019 if you wanted to be really a rowdy teenager, you got into a car, driven by a young man that had a rumble-seat, an\u2019 you drove across the line, to North Carolina, to a place called Spooky Hollow, an\u2019 danced to the jukebox. This was a time of growin\u2019 up. This was the time of Worl\u2019 War II. This is when I would go to a movie for twenty-five cents, could stay all day, paid ten cents for my popcorn. These were happy, beautiful times, but the mos\u2019 gorgeous times in my life came after I was married an\u2019 moved all over the country. An\u2019 I was teased about my Southe\u2019n accent. I was teased that, I could be found anywhere in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, because of the way I talked. But ironically enough, during that point of my life, there was a President Johnson in the White House, an\u2019 many of the people thought I had come from Texas, because their only exposure was to hear Ladybird Johnson. My Southern drawl has always proved me well, even though I thought ev\u2019ryone talked like I did. Until the moves. The moves have made me listen. The moves to Indiana began to tell me that: 1) They had no mountains, and 2) They talked flat. The move back south though, to the Deep South, was a rude awakening. How dare they call Virginia \u201cNorthern?\u201d Ev\u2019ry ancestor that I had rolled over in their grave the first time I had a friend in Alabama say, \u201cOh, you really are from the North.\u201d However, the l \u2014 Deep South welcomes you to their bosom, like a wide, wide oak tree. An\u2019 for that I\u2019m eternal grateful. \u2026"

And (uh) we\u2019d take the crabs that we wanted an\u2019 we\u2019d cook it, and (um) oh, goodness, it was such a nice way to spend a summer day.

An\u2019 eventually we had to get another horse, \u2019cause you can\u2019t keep a horse alone, \u2019cause, y\u2019 know, they go crazy if you keep \u2019em alone, so\u2026 But that was fun, and then finally, when I was 18, after high school, we just moved to Richmond, my mother\u2019s hometown, my late mother\u2019s hometown. An\u2019 Richmond was quite an experience. It\u2019s a lot differen\u2019, y\u2019 know, then\u2013 then the country. It, it\u2019s urban environment, and (um) I had never lived in the big city before, but it really helped me get that, y\u2019 know, make a nice start, y\u2019 know. \u2019Cause with the music \u2019n\u2019\u2013 I\u2019ll \u2014 An\u2019 so I, I\u2019ve been in Richmond for the last seven years, jus\u2019 playing music an\u2019 writing like I was before, and (uh) hopefully I\u2019ll get that hit record that I need.

And I can still remember him. We were all screaming, and he jumped \u2014 he would (uh) get his knee up in the back of the truck. And he had (uh) this huge head. And he was snortin\u2019 and, you know, trying to get us. And we were screaming, and Mom was driving as fast as she could go, and [laughs]. That\u2019s the two things I remember, back when I was \u2014 when I was young. One other thing too that was kinda fun: I wanted a horse so bad \u2014 I was just horse-crazy \u2014 that (uh) we would (um) train our calves to ride \u2019em. And my sister \u2014 we would play for hours down in the barn, leading our calves, running \u2019em up and down the driveway, pretending they were horses. And when (laughs) my pet calf got big enough, I trained it so I could ride it. And, we would come home f- \u2026 We made little bridles out of twine. And we\u2019d be riding\u2019em \u2014 well, it was gentle and everything, but when the cows come home, they get kind of excited and spunky, and they come running down through the\u2013 (laughs) through the (uh) pasture, and then they start bucking [laughs] and threw us off. So, but it was fun, and it didn\u2019t stop us. We did it again and again, but we\u2019d get knocked off. And they don\u2019t have the softest back to ride on either. If you look at a cow, they\u2019ve got a bony back, so when they\u2019re bucking, it doesn\u2019t feel very good. [laughs]"

Um, and, actually hiking up into the Big Horn Mountains. Uh, the hike\u2019s up into what\u2019s called Lake Sawtooth and the Cloud Peak wilderness. Uh, should be a lot of fun, uh, but, uh, up there you can\u2019t, uh, use any kinds of uh, fires or or that sort of thing; you have to, have to use the little backpacking hitchhiker\u2019s, uh, uh, fire stoves and everything, so we can\u2019t cut any wood or, or that sort of thing. Um, I enjoy also too road biking as well as, um, I enjoy pretty much any kind of sports activities. Um, and also though too I do enjoy theatre.
