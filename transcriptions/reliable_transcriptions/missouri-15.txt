Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. To the Hebrews, it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to fortale war or heavy rain. The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from Earth to their home in the sky. Others had tried to explain the phenomenon physically. Air subtle thought the rainbow was caused a reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. Since the physicist had found that it is not reflection, the reflection by the rain jobs which causes the rainbows. Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops and the width of the colored van increases as the size of the drops increases. The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with a normally wide yellow band. Since red and green light has, when next, form yellow, there is a very common type of bow. One showing mainly red and yellow with bow or no green or blue.
