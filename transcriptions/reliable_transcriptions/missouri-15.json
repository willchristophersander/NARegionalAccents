The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops and the width of the colored van increases as the size of the drops increases. The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with a normally wide yellow band. Since red and green light has, when next, form yellow, there is a very common type of bow.
