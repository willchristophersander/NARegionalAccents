{"text": " This recording, Missouri 11, is copyright the International Dialects of English Archive. When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air that act as a prism in former rainbow, the rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. You take the shape of a long-round arch with its path high above and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. There is, according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. People look but no one ever finds it. When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. I grew up in Kimberly and City, Missouri. It's close to Branson, usually the only city people know about down there. I used to work at the hard luck diner, which is part of Citadel or City, that was like the biggest part of the city, is this old cave, and they built a amusement park around it. I danced for a long time, like 13 years, I used to teach dance classes, I really liked the kids, so I had fun with that. Then I came to Kansas City and to come to college. Should I sit in any school? I'm here at UMKC. It's a lot of fun, although some reason I seem to have trouble wondering if I'm wondering if I'm in the right major. Sometimes I think I want to change to something else, but I think I'm in the right spot because I want to be a director. I want to direct music videos and maybe do some film, but they don't have a film major here. So I'm minoring in that, and this is the closest I can get in theater. I want to direct, I want to act, so I think I'll be okay. I want to talk properly and breathe properly. I don't have much else to say about myself.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 6.0, "text": " This recording, Missouri 11, is copyright the International Dialects of English
