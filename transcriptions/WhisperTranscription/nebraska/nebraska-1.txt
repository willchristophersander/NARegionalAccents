The rainbow's division of white light into the beautiful colors. These take the shape of a long round arch with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. There is a 1, 2 legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. People look, but no one ever finds it. When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friend say he's looking for a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. Throughout the centuries, people have explained the rainbow in various ways. Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. To the Hebrews, it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to Fertel War or heavy rain. The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from Earth to their home in the sky.
