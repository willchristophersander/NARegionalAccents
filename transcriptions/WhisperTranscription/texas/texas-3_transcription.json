  "text": "This recording, Texas III, is copyrighted the International Dietics of English Archive. When the sunlight strikes, rainbow drops, and they act as a prism and form a rainbow. The rainbow is a division of white light and too many beautiful colors. These take the shape of a long-round arc with its path high above and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. There is, according to legend, a boarding part of gold at one end. People look, but no one ever finds it. When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for a part of gold at the end of the rainbow. Throughout the centuries, people have explained the rainbow in various ways. Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. To the Hebrews, it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to Fort Hill. The Norsemen considered the rainbow as they were. Physists have found that it's not reflection, but reflection by the rainbow drops which causes the rainbows. Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops and the width of the colored ban. And increases as the size of the drops increases. The actual primary rainbow observed is set to the effect of superimposition of a number of balls. If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with a abnormally wide yellow ban, since red and green light makes it form yellow. This is a very common type of bow. I want to tell you why I appreciate my moments. I want to talk to them about something. I want to talk to them about something.",
