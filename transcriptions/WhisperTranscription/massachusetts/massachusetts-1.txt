The rainbow passage, when the sunlight strikes rainbops, drops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. These take the shape of a long round arch with its path high above and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. There is, according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. People look, but no one ever finds it. When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. My mother gave birth on a stormy January night in 1920 in a homeopathic hospital in Boston, mass. My first eight years were spent in a double-decker, bottom floor flat, surrounded by neighbors from Ireland, Poland, and England. A family read by gaslight, and mum cooked on a coal stove and a gas stove, which often ran out of gas in the middle of preparing supper. But not to worry, an oil lamp and matches were kept close by. Meanwhile, dad would get a quarter out of an old sugar bowl, and sometimes he would put me on his shoulder and let me drop the coin in the meter in the hallway. One memorable day some workmen arrived to install the wires for electricity. I remember sitting on the brick side walk dangling my feet through the cello window as I watched them work. The fixtures they put in the pala had beautiful orange frosted globes that cast a warm glow, and I'm sure that is why to this day orange is my favorite color. From Boston, I lived there for eight years, then we went maybe 30 miles to Quincy, which was on the water, and I spent the next, the next 21 years there, and then we moved inland a bit again to brain tree mass, which was maybe 15 or 20 miles away, and we spent 23 years there.
