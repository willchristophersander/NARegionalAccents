  "text": "This recording in Diana 1 is copyright the international dialects of English archive. It struck the ring drops in the air, the act that has a primary and formed a rainbow. The rainbow is a divided of white light and too many beautiful colors. These take the shape of a long round arch with its path high above, and to end appropriately below the horizon. There is a recording to legend a bowling. A bowling pot, a goal at one end. People look but do no one ever found it. When a man looked for something below this, his friend said he was looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. I have a family of seven sisters and one brother. We lived on a farm, was raised similar to the type of army's people. We milked 14, head of cows every morning. We got up at five o'clock. We had to milk. We had one old cow that wore kickers because she kicks the bad. We had the cleanest strainer and the separator and everything before we could get on the school bus and go to school. The school bus used to come around seven o'clock. I'd go to school all day and I'd come home. First thing I had to do with going now is change my clothes and go out to the barn and start bringing the cows in for the milking time. We fed the chickens and sloped the hogs. Then we might be out in the barn to about six o'clock because we always had to scrape the bottom down and put it on the floor. We never wore shoes because we didn't have, we were poor family, we didn't have shoes to wear. We had a lot of time to wear out and my mother would take cardboard in the barn and the shoes. We made our unders out of feed sacks that she'd buy the feed in for the chickens. They were friends. We had to go back and get that calf and the snow was really deep and we went back in and got that calf up for it. We were in dad passed away at 74 and 76, but as far as coming out of a big family, I wouldn't want it any other way. As girls is turned out to be terrific girls.",
