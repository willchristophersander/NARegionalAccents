Well, here's a story for you. Sir Harry was a venerian nurse who had been working daily at an old zoo. And it deserted just to the territory. So she was very happy to start a new job. At a sober private practice in North Square near Duke Street Tower, that area was much nearer for her and more to her liking. Even so on her first morning she felt stressed. She ate a bowl of porridge, there was a woman with a goose waiting for her. The woman gave Sarah an official letter from the vet. The letter implied that the animal could be suffering from a rare form of foot and mouth disease, which was surprising, because normally she would only expect to see that in a dog or a goat. So sentimental so this made her feel sorry for the beautiful bird. Before long, that itchy goose began to start around the office like a lunatic, which made the nurse Sarah mess. The goose owner Mary Harrison, Ketconning Kamma, Kamma, which Sarah thought was odd choice for a name. Kamma was strong and huge, so it would take some force to trap her. But Sarah had a different idea. Freshly tried Jenny stroking the goose's lower back with her palm. Then singing a tune to her, finally she and ministered. Either her efforts were not futile and no time the goose began to tire. So Sarah was able to hold onto Kamma and give her a relaxing bath. Once Sarah had managed to bathe the goose, she wiped her off with a cloth and daze her on her right side. Then Sarah confirmed that it's Diana the diagnosis. Almost immediately she remembered and affected treatment that required her to measure out a lot of medicine.<|tr|> Sarah warned that this course of treatment might be expensive either five or six times the cost of penicillin. I can imagine pain so much but Miss Harrison and milliner lawyer thought it was fair price for a cure. I grew up in South-Ele. There was a lot of artists that rap artists that grew up from that area. The section that I grew up in is Broadway 42nd.<|kn|> It I went to West Vernon Avenue. That was my elementary. My junior high was John Adams and my high school was Thomas Jefferson High School. I graduated in 1997 and I moved on to get married. Move to East-Ele and eventually move to North Hollywood right now.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 6.48, "text": " This recording, California 20, is copyright the
