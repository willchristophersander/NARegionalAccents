Go to the animal and apply it to the animal could be suffering from a rare form of foot and mouth disease which was surprising because normally you would only expect to see it in a dog or a goat. Sarah was sentimental so this made her feel sorry for the beautiful bird. Before long that itchy goose began to start around the office like a lunatic which made an unsanitary miss. The goose is owned by Mary Harrison and kept calling calmama calmama which Sarah thought was a not choice for a man. The animal was strong and huge so it would take some force to trap her but Sarah had a different idea. First she tried gently stroking the goose's lower back with her palm then singing a tune for her. Finally she administered death either. Traffords were not futile and no time the goose began to tire. Sarah was able to hold on to calmama and give her a relaxing bath. Once Sarah had managed to base the goose she wiped her off with that cloth and later on her right side.
