{"text": " This recording, Kansas 4, is copyright the international dialects of English archive. My dad used to dig great behind. When I got an earthquake, that had been in 1970. The old timers just did a lot of big ol' behind anymore. So, at the end of the first thing, I was digging very in the clouds and all around. And now we were up to 50, we've done the 56 different timetaries. And we dig for five different undertakers. It's a bit, and my dad always said, if you do people a good job and do it all of these work, well, you'll never be able to work, and he sure I've never been out of work. So, I went and business. But I dug up by that grown-up that worked in the clouds. The guy's wife died, and he's been buried 19 years. And his wife died, and the kids decided they wouldn't put that in a sealed wall. And he was buried in the 60s when they still used some wooden boxes. Well, he was in a wooden casket. The wooden casket was good, but the glue all gave way. So, when we opened up, we took the boards and I dug her grave first and then put a bolt down in there. And then we was to take him out and put him over there. And then we had to move all over. And the wooded all gave way, so we all think we could do, we could do take it. We could go over there. But when we opened up, you could see his hand bones. And if you watched pretty soon, then hand bones, they just slothed a little brown-looking dust. And he had a three-piece suit on. And his chest even stood up, but then my wife was there to watch it. That was her first exchange. For water, for waterline, well, they even have me coming which for graves. I can, I can wish a grave. And I don't know why it works. And he's got a, he's a piece tree. And he's got a hole with me.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 6.0, "text": " This recording, Kansas 4, is copyright the international dialects of English archive.", "tokens":
