{"text": " This recording, Missouri 13, is copyright the International Dialects of English Archive. When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. The rainbow is the division of white light in the many beautiful colors. This takes a shape of a long-round arch with its path high above and its two ends apparently be on the horizon. There is, according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. People look but no one ever finds it. When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friend says, looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. Throughout the centuries, oh, that's it. I grew up in Fair Grove, Missouri, and I've lived in the same place all the way growing up. My parents are originally from Sliny Kansas, and I don't know if that discredits this accent or not, but they lived there for quite a while before I was born. My parents are involved in the historical and preservation society of the town, and when I was a kid, we had a lot of animals. We had pigs and chickens and mules and draft horses and things like that, which is odd since we lived in the middle of town, which I guess says how small the town was. Population growing up was in the mid-600s, 640-something, I think. Now it's 919. It's a small town just out side of Springfield, Missouri, and we used to go shop in Springfield and get everything there, because there weren't many shops in Fair Grove.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 6.88, "text": " This recording, Missouri 13, is copyright the International Dialects of English Archive.", "tokens": [50364, 639, 6613, 11, 21334, 3705, 11, 307, 17996, 264, 9157, 29658, 557, 82, 295, 3669, 10984, 488, 13, 50708], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.19646468643070192, "compression_ratio": 1.6464968152866242, "no_speech_prob": 0.048341039568185806}, {"id": 1, "seek": 0, "start": 6.88, "end": 11.36, "text": " When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.", "tokens": [50708, 1133, 264, 18379, 16750, 3342, 471, 49715, 294, 264, 1988, 11, 436, 605, 382, 257, 582, 1434, 293, 1254, 257, 18526, 13, 50932], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.19646468643070192, "compression_ratio": 1.6464968152866242, "no_speech_prob": 0.048341039568185806}, {"id": 2, "seek": 0, "start": 11.36, "end": 14.88, "text": " The rainbow is the division of white light in the many beautiful colors.", "tokens": [50932, 440, 18526, 307, 264, 10044, 295, 2418, 1442, 294, 264, 867, 2238, 4577, 13, 51108], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.19646468643070192, "compression_ratio": 1.6464968152866242, "no_speech_prob": 0.048341039568185806}, {"id": 3, "seek": 0, "start": 14.88, "end": 19.28, "text": " This takes a shape of a long-round arch with its path high above and its two ends apparently", "tokens": [51108, 639, 2516, 257, 3909, 295, 257, 938, 12, 5453, 3912, 365, 1080, 3100, 1090, 3673, 293, 1080, 732, 5314, 7970, 51328], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.19646468643070192, "compression_ratio": 1.6464968152866242, "no_speech_prob": 0.048341039568185806}, {"id": 4, "seek": 0, "start": 19.28, "end": 24.0, "text": " be on the horizon.
