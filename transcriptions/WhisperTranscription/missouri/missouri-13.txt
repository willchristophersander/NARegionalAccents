The rainbow is the division of white light in the many beautiful colors. This takes a shape of a long-round arch with its path high above and its two ends apparently be on the horizon. There is, according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. People look but no one ever finds it. When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friend says, looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. Throughout the centuries, oh, that's it. I grew up in Fair Grove, Missouri, and I've lived in the same place all the way growing up. My parents are originally from Sliny Kansas, and I don't know if that discredits this accent or not, but they lived there for quite a while before I was born. My parents are involved in the historical and preservation society of the town, and when I was a kid, we had a lot of animals. We had pigs and chickens and mules and draft horses and things like that, which is odd since we lived in the middle of town, which I guess says how small the town was. Population growing up was in the mid-600s, 640-something, I think. Now it's 919. It's a small town just out side of Springfield, Missouri, and we used to go shop in Springfield and get everything there, because there weren't many shops in Fair Grove.
