Well, here's a story for you. Sarah Perry was a veterinary nurse who had been working daily and an old zoo in a deserted district of the territory. So she was very happy to start a new job at a superb private practice in North Square near the Duke Street Tower. That area was much nearer for her and more to her liking. Even so, on her first morning she felt stressed, shade a bowl of porridge, check herself in the mirror and watch her face in a hurry. Then she put on a plain yellow dress and a fleece jacket. Picked up her kit and headed for work. When she got there, there was a woman with a goose waiting for her. The woman gave Sarah an official letter from the vet. The letter implied that the animal could be suffering from a rare form of foot and mouth disease, which was surprising because normally you would only expect to see it in a dog or a goat. Sarah was sentimental. Sarah had a different idea. She remembered an effective treatment that required her to measure out a lot of medicine.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 6.04, "text": " This recording, New Jersey 3 is copyrighted the International Dialects of English Archive.", "tokens": [50364, 639, 6613, 11, 1873, 16601, 805, 307, 17996, 292, 264, 9157, 29658, 557, 82, 295, 3669, 10984, 488, 13, 50666], "temperature": 0.2, "avg_logprob": -0.3795005864110486, "compression_ratio": 1.4932885906040267, "no_speech_prob": 0.03502423316240311}, {"id": 1, "seek": 0, "start": 6.04, "end": 12.0, "text": " Kamu gets a cure, he is copyright Douglas N.
