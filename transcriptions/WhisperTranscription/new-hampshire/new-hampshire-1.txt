The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. These take the shape of a long-round art with its path high above, and it's two ends, apparently beyond the horizon. There is, according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. People look, but no one ever finds it. When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he's looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. I live in New Hampshire in Mermack, and I like it because like his nose here and there's a lot of skiing places. And it's fun. So I just go learning. My family, I have one sister and her name's Caitlin, and a mom and a dad, and they're both teachers. And my mom loves to go skiing and my dad loves to go fishing. And I'm in middle school. And I love school because I see my friends and their school dances. That's fun. And the sports I do, I do a lot actually. I do soccer, basketball, horseback ride, and I dance. So that's fun. And my favorite foods, that's a lot. I like pizza and grilled cheese and macaroni and cheese. Those are my favorites. And then cheddar cheese. Am I playing for the future? I want to be either a writer or a kindergarten teacher like my mom. So, and I want to have a family in my own. Pretty much what I want to do in my life.
