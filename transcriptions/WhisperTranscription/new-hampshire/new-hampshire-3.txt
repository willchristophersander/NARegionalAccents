Sarah was a nurse who worked in Newtown. She was very happy to start a new job in North Square. And yet Duke Street, on her first morning she watched a face, put on a plane white dress and a fleece jacket. Picked up her kit and headed for work. When she got there, there was a woman waiting for. The woman gave her a letter from the vet. The letter implied that the animal could be suffering from foot and mouth disease, which was very rare. Because normally, you would only expect a seat and a goat. This made Sarah feel sigh for the bird. The goose began to strut around the office, which made an unsanitary mess. The owner, Mary Harrison, kept calling. Come on, come on. Which, Sarah thought was an odd choice for a name. Common was strong and huge. So it took some force to travel. But she managed by gently stroking the goose with her palm. Then she gave her a relaxing bath, washed her, and later on a cloth for diagnosis. She gave the goose a lot of medicine, which was very expensive. But Mrs. Harrison thought it was a fair price for a cure. That's really interesting. But I don't get back there too often. Which is insane to me, but God, I lived there for 20 years. No, I lived there for 18 years. And then when I went to college, I moved to a town called Bold. a friend of mine was working with this agent in Boston.
