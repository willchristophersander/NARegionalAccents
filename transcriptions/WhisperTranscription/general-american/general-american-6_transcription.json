  "text": "This recording, General American 6, is copyright the international dialects of English archive. Come and get to the cure. Is copyright Douglas N. Onroff, Jill McCullough, and Barbara Summavill. Well, here's a story for you. Sarah Perry was a veterinarian nurse who had been working daily at an old zoo in a deserted district of the territory, and she was very happy to start a new job at a superb private practice in North Square near the Duke Street Tower. That area was much near to her, and more to her liking, and even so on her first morning she felt stressed. She ate a bowl of porridge, checked herself in the mirror, and washed her face in a hurry. Then she put on a plain yellow dress and a fleece jacket, picked up her kit and headed. Amazing, because normally you would only expect to see it in a dog or a goat. Sarah was sentimental, so this made her feel sorry for the beautiful bird. Before long, that itchy goose began to strut around the office like a lunatic, which made gently stroking the goose's lower back with her palm, then singing a tune to her. Finally, she administered ether. She was a volunteer out of medicine. Sarah warned that this course of treatment might be expensive, either five or six times a cost of penicillin. I can't imagine paying so much that Mrs. Harrison, a millionaire lawyer, thought it was a fair price for a cure.",
