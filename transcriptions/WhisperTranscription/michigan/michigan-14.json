Comic gets a cure. Well, here's a story for you. Sarah Perry was a veterinary nurse who had been working daily and an old zoo in a deserted district of the territory. So she was very happy to start a new job at a suburb private practice in North Square near the Duke Street Tower. That area was much nearer for her and more to her liking. Even so, on her first morning she felt stressed. In a dog or a goat. Sarah warned that this course of treatment might be expensive either five or six times the cost of kind of the course thought I was odd. I can't do it. There were a few different words. We had a cottage on Lake Superior. It was a family cottage. My grandfather bought it and so all of my mothers, well, two sisters and then all of the cousins used it all the time. And it was a call to cottage. It's called camp. And all of the cottages that we think of as cottages, everything is called camp. We're going up to camp. That means you're going up to the cottage. Lake Superior takes a long long time to get warm in the summer but it's one of the things that my cousin and I would do was see who could stay in the water the longest without turning blue. Lots of camp fires.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 6.6000000000000005, "text": " This recording, Michigan 14, is copyright the international dialects of English archive.",
