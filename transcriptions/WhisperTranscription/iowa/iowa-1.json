Well, here's a story for you. Sarah Perry was a veterinary nurse who has been working daily at an old zoo in a deserted district of the territory, and she was very happy to start a new job at a superb private practice in North Square near Duke Street Tower. That area was much nearer for her and more to her liking, even so on her first morning she felt stressed. She ate a bowl of porridge, checked herself in the mirror, and washed her face in a hurry. Then she put up, put on a plain yellow dress and a fleece jacket, picked up her kit and headed for work. When she got there, there was a woman with a goose waiting for her. This woman gave Sarah an official letter from the vet. The letter implied that the animal could be suffering from a rare form of food. Which was surprising because normally you would only expect to see a dog or a goat. Sarah was sentimental, so this made her feel sorry for the beautiful bird. Before long, the itchy goose began to strut around the office, like Illumatic, which made an unsanitary mess. The goose owner, Mary Harrison, kept calling, Kamma Kamma, which Sarah thought would be an odd choice for a name. Kamma was a strong and huge, so it would take some force for her to trap her, and Sarah had a different idea. First she tried gently stroking the goose's lower back with her palm, then singing attune for her. Finally she had demonstrated, either. Her efforts were not futile. In no time, the goose began to tire, so Sarah was able to hold onto Kamma and give her relaxing bath. Once Sarah had managed to bathe the goose, she wiped off her off with a cloth and laid her on her right side. I'm from a small town in Northwest Iowa. A lot of my friends have gone far, but I lived in town.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 6.04, "text": " This recording, Iowa 1, is copyright the international dialects of
