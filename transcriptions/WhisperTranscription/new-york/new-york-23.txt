Well, here's a story for you. Sarah Perry was a veterinary nurse who had been working daily at an old zoo in a deserted district of the territory. So she was very happy to start a new job at a superb private practice in North Square near the Duke Street Tower. That area was much nearer for her and more to were liking. Which was surprising because normally you would only expect to see it in a dog or a goat. Sarah was sentimental, so this made her feel sorry for the beautiful bird. Then she had been back with her palm, then singing a tune to her. Finally she administered ether. Her efforts were not futile, and no time the goose began to tire, so Sarah was able to hold on to comma and give her a relaxing bath. Once Sarah had managed to bathe the goose, she wiped her off with a cloth and later on a ride side. But then Sarah confirmed the vet's diagnosis. And then my parents moved to North Square, and my parents moved to North of Syracuse, New York, and the first place we moved was to Fulton, New York. I don't have a lot of memories of that. In Fulton for about six months, I mean all I remember is that I cried a lot because we moved away from my childhood home and stuff. But then we moved to Clay, New York, it's a town called Clay, and then we ended up in, there for about a year, and then we ended up in Baldwin'sville, New York. So I grew up basically in Beville, and went to school in Syracuse, like in the City. I mean I went to elementary school in town, like in Baldwin'sville, at St. Mary's.
