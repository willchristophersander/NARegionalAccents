Well, here's the story for you. Sarah Perry was a veterinary nurse who had been working daily and an old zoo in the deserted district of the territory. So she was very happy to start a new job at a superb private practice in North Square near the Duke City Tower. That area was much near for her and more to her liking. She was strong and huge so it would take some time to force the trapper but Sarah had a different idea. First she tried gently stroking the goose's lower back with her palm then seeing a tune to her. Finally, she administered either. Sarah warned that this course of treatment might be expensive either five or six times the cost of penicillin. I can't imagine paying so much but Mrs. Harrison a millionaire lawyer thought it was a fair price for a cure. The younger one was in love with Ariel so they made that connection and I knew they would love being at San Diego. Early in the morning walking around the it kind of sits on a little by you know and there's the the water all around. We all my her daughters the four of us would get together is the early part of December to make them others. So they get they're really hard they're flexible and then we would form a line and some of us would spread the flower. And a lot of people like it different ways but we we only put black olives in it. We made and then they'd be ready to go in a Christmas time and Christmas Eve you take them out and look whatever.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 6.44, "text": " This
