Well, here's a story for you. Sarah was a nurse who had been working in a deserted district of the territory for a long time, so she was very happy to start a new job in North Square near the Duke Street Tower. That area was much near for her and more to her liking. Even so, on her first morning, she felt stressed. She checked herself with a mirror and washed her face in a hurry. Then she put on a plain white dress and a furry yellow fleece jacket, picked up her kit and headed The goose's owner, Mary Harrison, kept calling, Kamma Kamma, which Sarah thought was an odd choice for her name. Kamma was strong and huge, so it took some force to chop her, but Sarah managed by gently stroking Okay, so when I was six years old, I was playing the door mouse in Alisson stuff, so I just went around to the back of it whenever I had to get in. And so I do my solo number where I get to hit the mad hat over the head with the fly swatter and get to misspirinance a lot of words. It's really, really neat. And um, just as I'm getting back into the teapot from the back, I fall off the table onto the corner of the platform, banging the side of my head ridiculously hard and everyone starts cracking up and poor Alice, I don't remember a name or anything, but you know, everyone's like panicking on stage and poor Alice is trying to lift me up, but at the same time she's cursing the shoving ice packs under my hood to try to, you know, numb it or whatever and I'm sitting there crying but that's my like, my trauma for my life is that I did not say on stage and I was the door mouse when I was six years old.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.08, "end": 5.92, "text": " This recording, Florida IV, is copyrighted into national dialects of English archived.", "tokens": [50368, 639, 6613, 11,
