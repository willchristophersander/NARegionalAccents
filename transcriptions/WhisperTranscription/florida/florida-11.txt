Well, here's a story for you. Sarah Perry was a veteran airy nurse who had been working daily at an old zoo in a deserted district of the territory. So she was very happy to start a new job at a superb private practice in North Square, near the Duke Street Tower. Emily would only expect to see it in a dog or a goat. Sarah was sentimental, so this made her feel sorry for the beautiful bird. Before long, that itchy goose began to strut around the office like the lunatic, which made an unsignitary mess. The goose's owner, Mary Harrison, kept calling, Kamakama, or Kamakama, which Sarah thought was an odd choice for a name. Kamama was strong and huge, so it would take some force to trap her, but Sarah had a different idea. First she tried, gently stroking the goose's lower back with her palm, then singing along, or a lot of medicine. I lived in Milton for the first three years of my life and my parents got a divorce, and me and my older sister, who's about five years older than me, went to live with my mom in a bicycle of beach. We've been there since, and I'm 19 now, so my mom is still out living on the beach, and I have one sister, and I still get along with both parents, and my mom is an ultra-santic knowledge. My father travels around the world and works on generating power plants, and so he gets to see a lot of different things in a lot of different places, which is neat.
