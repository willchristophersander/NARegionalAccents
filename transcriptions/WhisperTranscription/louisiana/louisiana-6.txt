Was a very narrow nurse who had been working daily at an old zoo and a desert district of territory, so she was very happy to start a new job at a suburban private practice in North Square near Duke Street, Dowell. That was much near for her and more for her liking, even so on the first morning she felt stressed. She ate a bowl of porridge, checked herself in the mirror, washed her face in the hurry, then she put a plain yellow dress and a fleece jacket, picked up her kit and headed to work. When she got there, there was a woman with a goose wedding for her. The woman gave Sarah an official letter from the vet, a letter implied that an animal could be suffering from a rare form of footing mouth disease, which was surprisingly because normally she would only expect to see it in the dog or a goat. Sarah was cement sentimental, so she made her feel sorry for a beautiful bird. Before long, that itchy goose began to strut around the office like a lunatic, which made an incendiary mess. The goose on her marry hash kept calling, and the comma comma would share it thought was odd choice for a name, and the comma was strong and huge, so it was like it would take some force to trap her. And no time the goose began to tie, so Sarah was able to hold on to comma and give her a relaxing bath. When Sarah had managed the bath, the goose she wiped off her face, wiped off what they treated, it might be expensive either five or six times across a pen and a seven. I can't imagine paying so much for Mrs. Harsons, a millionaire, or you thought it was fair price for a kid. In 19 children, I was just 19 children, and we all from the south and my hair did just German and Indian and Cajun and some French.
