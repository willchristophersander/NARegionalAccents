{"text": " This recording, Illinois 5, he is copyrighted the international dialects of English archived. When the sunlight strikes rain drops in the air, they act like a prison and form a rainbow. The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. These take the shape of a long round arch with its path high above, and it's two ends apparently beyond the horizon. There is a according to legend of boiling pot of gold at one end. People look but no one ever finds it. When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. When I was younger, we'd go to the family dentist, and our family dentist's name was Dr. Harry Richard Mull. And he's a very, very jovial man, he had a big belly and he tried to make jokes while he was inspecting my teeth, but he had really, really bad breath, which was bizarre because this is a dentist, you know, why would he have bad breath? He should know better. And when he would get in close and he'd be talking, it was almost too much to take because, you know, you're really breathing out of your nose because he's working with your mouth. And one time when he was fiddling around with something by my throat, my gag reflexes reacted and I smelled his breath and ended up throwing up all over his white smock. And which was insane, pretty crazy. My mom thought it was really funny, but she was embarrassed and we had to switch dentists. We live in Linwood, which is right on the border of Munster and Diana, which has caused a deep pitied resachment for Indiana people. We really don't like the people in Indiana. It's the whole running gag. They say we can't drive, we say they can't drive. And so also we live in kind of a, it's not the greatest neighborhood in the world, economic-wise. And it's right next to a little, little more better off, town. And there's also a little resentment towards those people. So maybe a little snabbish.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 2.4, "text": " This recording, Illinois 5,", "tokens": [50364, 639, 6613, 11, 17508, 1025, 11, 50484],
