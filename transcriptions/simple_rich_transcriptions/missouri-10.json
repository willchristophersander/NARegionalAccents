When the sunlight starts rain drops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. These take the shape of a long, round arch with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. There is, according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. People look but no one ever finds it. When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. Camelod is a summer fine arts camp for children. It's in its 35th year or just completed its 35th year. Children ages pre-K through 10th grade, go through morning classes of art, dance, drama, vocal music, guitar, and there are three divisions. Junior division is pre-K through 3rd grade. Senior division is 4th 8th grade, and apprentices are 9th and 10th grade, and all at the same time within a six-week period we are doing musicals. Oh, let's see. We used to have overnights every Thursday night after showcase, which is a performance that kids do. And some of the campers who shall remain nameless, used to sneak off with other campers who shall remain nameless. And Gina, who's the director, used to go around the corner and scare them half-to-death because she's triple-joined it and she can make her hands look really silly. And it worked. It frightened everybody.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 5.2, "text": " This recording, Missouri 10, is copyright the International Dialects of English Archive.", "tokens": [50364, 639, 6613, 11, 21334, 1266, 11, 307, 17996, 264, 9157, 29658, 557, 82, 295, 3669, 10984, 488, 13, 50624], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.30084713718347383, "compression_ratio": 1.582191780821918, "no_speech_prob": 0.02268644981086254}, {"id": 1, "seek": 0, "start": 6.08, "end": 11.28, "text": " Come and get secure.
