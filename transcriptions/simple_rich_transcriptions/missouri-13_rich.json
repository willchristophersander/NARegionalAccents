I grew up in Fair Grove, Missouri, and I lived in the same place, like all the way growing up. And my parents are originally from Sliny Kansas, and I don't know if that discredits this accent or not, but they live there for quite a while before I was born. And my parents are involved in the historical and preservation society of the town. And when I was a kid, we had a lot of animals. We had pigs and chickens and mules and draft horses and things like that, which is odd. Since we lived in the middle of town, you know, which, I guess, says how small the town was. Population, growing up was in the mid-600s, 640 something, I think. And now it's 919. It's a small town just outside of Springfield, Missouri. And we used to go shop in Springfield and get everything, get everything there, because there wasn't, there weren't many shops in Fair Grove.",
