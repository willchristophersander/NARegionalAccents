If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band since red and green light when mixed, form yellow. This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow with little or no green or blue. I was born and raised in a small town just outside of Birmingham called Adamsville. There was about 250 people in the entire town, little tiny place, everybody knew everything about everybody, which is probably effects of a lot of how I am today, kind of keeping everything quiet so the neighbors won't find out. Now I am a senior theater major at Birmingham Southern with no clue about what I am going to do when I get out of here. But I live with my parents and my grandmother. We all live together and it has been that way for about 10 years now. It is kind of weird because you see people out with their families, usually the parents and the kids sitting at the table in the restaurant or whatever. You look over and see my family and my parents and me sitting next to my grandmother with her big white hair. She always orders the same thing at restaurants, salad and baked potato. She grew up in Mississippi so she doesn't eat a lot of meat. She only eats things that have been pulled directly from the ground, unless she is cooked herself. Then she will open up the can and fix it right. That is one good thing about growing up with a grandmother and the cooking is always wonderful. My mom unfortunately has fallen out of practice of cooking and she is like, oh well I guess I will just get a mother to do it because I can't do anything anymore. I guess that is where I get most of my accent which is a lot thicker when I talk about them. When I talk to them it is even thicker. I guess being in the theater I have tried my best to be able to hide it as much as possible. But it still sneaks in there occasionally. My favorite food, oh goodness there are so many. I guess it would have to be my grandmother's cornbread. She makes the best cornbread in the world, in a skillet, in the oven. It is all crispy all over. Not these little muffins that you get in the restaurant. It has got to be this big loaf of cornbread cut in little wedges and it is so soft in the middle and so crispy and almost burnt on the outside. It is just incredible. It is the best thing in the world."

The rainbow is the division of white light into many beautiful colors. They take the shape of a long round arch with this path high above and it's too ends apparently beyond their horizon. There is, according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. People look, but no one ever finds it. When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. I've lived in Birmingham all of my life. My mother was originally from Michigan, but she spent most of her life down here in Alabama. And my father has always lived here. I went to Hewitt Trustville, which is a really po-dunk kind of school, but it was a lot of fun. It taught me a lot of characterization, which is very useful in theater. I'm a sophomore musical theater major here at Birmingham Southern. And I plan when I get out of school to maybe venture a little bit, maybe into Nashville, maybe Georgia, but not New York yet. It's a little scary, it's a little too big and busy for me. The characters from my school would wear cowboy boots to school and the big cowboy hats. And they'd talk about hunting all the time and what they did, how many dares they caught over the weekend and what they shot at with and do you like theirs. I'd have to say, I like them, but I don't really like to shoot them. And my great-grandmother actually was my favorite part about growing up as a child because she would always cook this incredible Thanksgiving meal. Just like her, she had the cornbread. And she's to fess at me about not eating enough every single Thanksgiving. She's like, don't you want some more stuff? Girl, you're getting skinnier every year. You just like a little bird. And she would fess at me so much, but it was one of my favorite memories. Oh, she used to love to make black-eyed peas and green beans, turkey, and ham, and a coconut cake. Coconut cream cake, every Thanksgiving, it was the best. I have two brothers, one's older and one's younger, the little one's same as Bobby. And he hasn't developed a real strong Southern accent yet, and I'm hoping he never will, but the first year I came home from college and I had all the vocal training. He looked at me and I had said something to him and he looked at me and he was like, you done lost your accent? And I was like, Bobby, I wasn't aware that I ever had an accent. And he was, oh, yeah, you did. So he laughed at me a lot. And he calls me hoity-toity now because I don't talk with the Southern accent. I didn't have to work as hard as other people do. I still, I hear it in my voice sometimes. And I try really hard not to let it come through. But I kind of appreciate it. I think it adds more voice to my, more character to my voice. And I kind of cherish it."

    "transcript": "This recording, Alabama 3, is copyright the International Directive English Archive. Comma gets a cure, is copyright Douglas and on-roft, Jill McCullough and Barbara Somerville. Sarah was a nurse who had been working in the newest area of the territory. She was very happy to start another new job, this time in North Square near the Duke Street Tower. On a first morning she washed her face, put on a plain white dress and a fleece jacket, picked up her kit and headed for work. When she got there there was a woman with a goose waiting for her. The woman gave Sarah a letter from the vet. The letter implied that the animal could be suffering from a rare form of foot and mouth disease, which was surprising because normally you would only expect to see it in a goat. Sarah was sentimental, so this made her feel sorry for the bird. The goose began to strut around the office like a lunatic, which made an unsanitary miss. The goose's owner, Mary Harrison, kept calling. Comma, which Sarah thought was an odd choice for a name. Comma was strong and huge, so it took some force to trap her, but Sarah managed by gently stroking the goose's lower bat with her palm and singing to her. Her efforts were not futile, very soon Comma began to tire and Sarah gave her a relaxing bath. Washed her and laid her on a cloth for diagnosis. Almost immediately Sarah remembered an effective treatment that required her to measure out a lot of medicine. The treatment was very expensive, but Mrs. Harrison, millionaire, thought it was a fair price for a cure. I was born in Northeastern Alabama. I was born in Jackson County, and that's in the foothills of Appalachian Mountains. Jackson County borders on Georgia, Antinocene. My ancestors had probably lived there for well over 100 years. I was raised on a farm. My father had a cotton farm and a corn farm. And so as I grew up, I picked cotton, pulled cotton, pulled corn, fed animals, and worked in a chicken house. And having done all that, I don't think there's anything that is beneath my doing. If you've sloped hogs, you can do lots of things. I attended a small school. I think there were 15 folks in my ninth grade class. My parents were unable to finish school, them say, because of their economic circumstances. My father was an orphan by the time he was 14 and my mother grew up in a very poor family. So they were not able to finish high school. The teachers that I had were very quickly my role models. And I would look toward them for what I was hoping my future would be, which would not be out somewhere in the hot sunshine picking cotton. There's not a lot of free time on a farm, but as I remember back on the things that we did in our leisure time, I remember simple things like playing hot hopscotch, playing with dolls, playing in a playhouse outdoors, watching TV, playing dress up, listening to the radio. And our homes were close together, although we lived in a farming community. So many times we would meet our neighbor friends outside and we would ride our bikes. We would play softball. Sometimes we would have war with corn cobs, which could be quite dangerous at times. I remember riding my bicycle with a neighbor. She was riding the bicycle. I was on the handlebars and somebody was on the back seat. We had this giant hill that we would travel down. And one day as we were driving down the hill, we were seemed to be going at the speed of light. And I was ejected from the bicycle, went rolling down the hill and have two scars now to prove that I was in that accident. So most of our free time was being just doing the simple kind of outdoorsy sorts of things. Not a lot of TV watching just very limited TV were wheeled out. I also remember when we first got our telephone, which I suppose people of my generation had telephones when they were born. But I didn't. And I remember I was probably about nine or ten years old when we first got our phone and we had a party line. So if you were to use the phone, you would pick up the phone and you would hear other conversations. You really would want to listen to those conversations, but you knew it was wrong. So you would quickly pick it up and then hang up the phone. And I remember being limited to my time on the phone to 15 minutes I couldn't talk any longer than 15 minutes on the telephone. Which is probably a lot different from our young folks today. As I think about growing up and I think about some of my bond memories, a lot of those would revive around holidays. One in particular is Halloween. And I think Halloween is still one of my favorite times, simply because of the experience that I had at Miss Davis' home. Miss Davis wasn't elderly lady and she seemed to be elderly all my life. And she had had a large family. So she had a dining room table that said either 12 or 14 people. I can't recall exactly which. But at Halloween she would have her table just heavy with all her home baked goodies. She would have popcorn balls, candid apples, cookies, cupcakes. Christmas was a fun time just like it is for all kids. My sister and I spent a good bit of time playing the guessing game. Mr. Wear our mom might have hidden our gifts. And particularly I remember the Christmas that we were to receive stuffed animals. Stuffed animals were really the rage. All the young girls wanted a huge stuffed animal in Soda Whee. So we prowled through the house until we found our stuffed animals. I received a pink poodle and my sister had a purple poodle. And we played with those for hours when our parents weren't inside the home and tried to put on a really surprised face the day that we looked under the Christmas tree. Although we had been enjoying them for weeks."
