So, she was very happy to start a new job at a superb private practice in North Square near  the Duke Street Tower. That area was much near for her and more to her liking, even so on her  first morning, she felt stressed. She ate a bowl of pork, porridge, oatmeal, mevia, checked herself  in the mirror and washed her face in a hurry. Then she put on a plain yellow dress and a fleece jacket,  picked up her kit and had it for work. When she got there, there was a woman with a goose waiting  for her. A woman gave Sarah, an official letter from the vet. The letter implied that the animal could  be suffering from a rare form of foot and mouth disease, which was surprising because normally  you would only expect to see it in a dog or a goat. Sarah was sentimental. So, this made her feel  sorry for the beautiful bird. Before long, that itchy goose began to strut around the office  like lunatic. It's five and one may be. Where was the lunatic? Which made an unsenitary mess?  The goose's owner, Mary Harrison, kept calling, comma comma. Which Sarah thought was an odd  choice for a name. comma was strong in huge. So, it would take some force to trap her.  But Sarah had a different idea. First, she tried gently stroking the goose,  goose's lower back with a palm that's singing a tune to her. Finally, she had ministered  ether. Her effort was not futile. In no time the goose began to tie her. So, Sarah was able to hold  onto comma and give her a relaxing bath. When Sarah had managed to bathe the goose, she wiped her off  with a cloth and laid her on her right side. Then Sarah confirmed the vet's diagnosis.  Almost immediately, she remembered an effective treatment that required her to measure out a lot of medicine.  Sarah wanted that this course of treatment might be expensive. Either five or six times  the cost of penicillin. I can imagine paying so much. But Mrs. Harrison, a millionaire lawyer, thought",
