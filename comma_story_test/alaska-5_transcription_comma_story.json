  "story_text": "Well, here's a story for you.  Sarah Perry was a visionary, who had been working daily at an old zoo in a dessert to district of the territory.  So she was very happy to start a new job at a superb private practice,  in the north-swear near the Duke Street Tower.  That area was much nearer for her, and more toward her liking.  Even so, on her first morning, she felt stressed.  She ate a bowl of porridge, checked herself in the mirror and washed her face in a hurry.  Then she put on a plain yellow dress and a face jacket,  picked up her kit and hated for work.  When she got there, there was a woman with a goose waiting for her.  The woman gave Sarah an official letter from the vet.  The letter implied that the animal could be suffering from a rare form of foot and mouth disease,  which was surprising because normally you would only expect to see in a dog or a goat.  Sarah was sentimental, so this made her feel sorry for the beautiful bird.  Before the long, that's the agey goose began to strut around the office like a heganetic,  which made an unsanitary mess.  The goose's owner Mary Harrison kept calling Koma, Koma,  which Sarah thought was not choice for the name.  Koma was strong and huge, so it takes some force to drop her,  but Sarah had a different idea.  First, she tried gently stroking the goose's lower back with her palm,  then singing a tune to her.  Sarah warned that this course of tribute might be expensive.  Either five or six times the course of pain is silly,  like anti-match and paying so much for Mrs. Harrison and Amelia in her",
